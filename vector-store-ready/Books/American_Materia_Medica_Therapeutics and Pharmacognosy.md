PREFACE.

In the seventeen years that have elapsed since Ellingwood’s Materia
Medica, Therapeutics and Pharmacognosy in its original form was published,
so great are the changes that have taken place in the practice of medicine;
so many are the discoveries that have been made and the theories and new
measures that have been advanced, and so many are the new remedies that
have been brought forward, that I have thought best to rewrite that work
almost entirely, and to put it out in a different form.

In the time specified, advancement has been made in every branch of
therapy. In the two or three decades prior to that time a prejudice had
slowly developed against the use of plant drugs, and this still influences
many. However, the knowledge of the superior action of the alkaloids has
rendered many of these indispensable. Furthermore, the securing of a definite,
advanced, accurate, and reliable knowledge of the action of those agents
which are made from the plant in whole or in part, and especially since the
manufacturers of the Specific Medicines have so perfected this form of fluid
medicines, that they can always be depended upon to secure accurate results;
all this has given to the profession a confidence in these drugs that is irresistible, because based upon their rational, organic, and invariable chearacter.

Again the foreign supply of drugs of all characters has been cut off so
fully by the European war, that American physicians have their attention
forced upon American products, and they are quickly learning that our
drug products are amply sufficient, with a little readjustment in some cases,
to meet every possible moderate demand of every branch of our profession.
This is indeed gratifying to those who have long studied these drugs in their
every possible character and influence, and have learned all their superior
qualities and have witnessed the immediate and superior influences in innumerable cases. This leads to a more general use, and this use confirms the
impression made upon the mind of the prescriber that organic remedies have
constant, subtle, invariable properties that no other class of remedies can
possibly possess. This brings us nearer than ever before to a general recognition of plant drugs—organic remedies—as the true medicines for human
ailments, just as organic foods are the only foods for man in health. Artificial foods are only readjustments of chemical and physiological food principles in organic form.

All this has caused me to desire to produce a work on American Medicines that will fully supply the immediate demands of American physicians,
to give the profession at large the results of the investigations, observations, experiences, and successful uses of the class of medicines above named,
which have been secured during the past century, and to bring this ‘up with
every essential proven fact, to the beginning of the year 1916.

In this work every statement has been weighed. Every fact has been
estimated fully in order that it shall be accurate. The best known author23

ities in these lines have been consulted, that the work shall be at once recognized as highly authoritative in every practical particular.

While this aspiration is plainly a worthy one, it is a presumption of the
highest order to believe that one man alone could accomplish it. This is a oneman work only in very small part. This book contains the results of the
observations of perhaps 25,000 practicing physicians. The statements are
made from comparisons and from conclusions drawn from the bedside observations of all. With these, the author has endeavored to make severe and accurate adjustments of his own observations and experiences during forty
years of family, office, hospital and out-consultation practice. Our earnest
effort has been made to make the work widely cosmopolitan; as far as possible unprejudiced, scientific, strictly practical, and rational.

I have been encouraged to undertake this work; indeed I have felt a conscientious impulsion to undertake it, from the almost universal praise, commendation, and congratulations received from the thoughtful, successful,
practical men of every school of medicine. It would be practically impossible to declare which school has been the most generous in their patronage.

With faith in the sincerity of these sentiments, with hope for their full
continuance, and with the assurance of Divine assistance and guidance, I
give this present work to the Profession and through them to humanity.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
of Ellingwood’s Materia Medica Therapeutics and Pharmacognosy.

In presenting this work to students and physicians, the author desires to
state that although it covers the field considered by other writers, it presents
in addition the more recent observations of the action of drugs, many of
which have never before appeared in book form, and the author’s personal
observations. There has been a need for a revision of our literature on this
subject for several years past, and for the addition thereto of the results of
the more recent observations and experiences. Up to the present time our
literature has contained the results of the application of the principles of
direct therapeutics originally enunciated, but there has been an evolution—
a development, a progressive knowledge—of these principles, which was anticipated and desired by Scudder, King and others, which should be embodied
in our permanent literature. These advancements it has been the aim of the
author to present in this book, and also to show the consistency as a whole, of
our principles concerning the influence of drugs, as applied in the investigations made, and here recorded.

It is possible that the confident expressions made in some cases concerning drug action may be received by many with incredulity, and it is possible
also that the idea may have been expressed more strongly than the author
intended, but to those who have had experience in prescribing the remedies
here considered according to their specific symptomatology, after a careful,
exact diagnosis of all the conditions of the disease for which prescribed, the
confidence acquired by their successes will in most cases confirm the sanguine
expressions of the author.

The author is under the greatest of obligations to Prof. John Uri Lloyd,
of Cincinnati, not only for his most valuable contribution on the subject of
Pharmacy and Pharmacognosy, but for the deep personal interest he has
taken in the work, and for the willingness with which he has given advice,
and tendered most valuable suggestions and encouragement, and for the
valuable monographs furnished by himself and by the firm of Lloyd Bros.
The author also desires to express his obligations and sincere regard for the
assistance and encouragement most generously given by Prof. Anson L.
Clark, of Chicago, with whom the author has felt free to advise during the
entire period of the formation of his plans for, and the publication of this
work.

Recognition is due the firm of Parke, Davis & Co., of Detroit, for their
generous contribution of a series of monographs, nearly sixty in number,
upon the origin, history, botanical character, and therapeutic properties of
new and valuable vegetable remedies, and the freedom they have granted in
the use of the information there obtained.

The faithful character of those parts of this work, devoted to the Materia
Medica of the Vegetable remedies, and to Electro-therapeutics, is almost


<!-- chunk -->

entirely due to the faithful and careful study, untiring research, and persistent effort of Dr. A. W. Smith, of Chicago, late professor of Materia Medica
in Bennett Medical College, who has labored constantly with the author during the entire year just past in the preparation of those parts of the work.

The strongest expressions of gratitude are due to all physicians, with
whom the author has consulted concerning the character and scope of this
book, for the very generous confidence they have expressed in its ultimate
character, and for the warm words of encouragement and assurances of support they have offered, the influence of which has been a source of much help
in the many hours of discouragement and depression, which the character
of a work of this kind naturally entails.

In the preparation of the material for this work, and in the collection
of the facts, the author has drawn freely upon the entire literature of the
Eclectic School, and in the capacity of editor of The Chicago Medical Times,
has for many years preserved files, clippings and made memoranda of suggestions from the entire exchange list of the current medical literature of all
schools. The following authors are among those who have been freely consulted: King’s American, The United States, and the National Dispensatories,
and Scudder, Locke, Watkins, Webster, Ringer, Shoemaker, Hale, J. Henri
Leonard, Wood, Bartholow, and Butler on Therapeutics, Gray’s Manual of
Botany, Bentham & Hooker’s British Flora, J. N. & C. G. Lloyd, Drugs and
Medicines of North America, Parke, Davis & Co., Pharmacology of the Newer
Materia Medica, Johnson & Johnson, Monographs on Belladonna.

The medical journals most frequently quoted are The Eclectic Medical
Journal, The Gleaner, The American Medical Journal, The Chicago Medical
Times, The California Medical Journal, The Western Druggist, The Therapeutic Gazette, The Medical Record, The London Lancet, The Medical Age,
The New York Medical Times, The American Journal of Pharmacy, The
Pharmaceutical Journal, The National Druggist.

If the facts here presented should give a renewed impulse to investigation into direct drug action, and should in the least assist the physician in
the prompt relief of human suffering, the efforts of the author will not have
been unavailing.

GENERAL THERAPEUTIC CONSIBERATIONS,

AND DEFINITION.

Materia Medica is the consideration of drugs, their origin and methods
of preparation, their chemical construction and constituents, general physical
characteristics, preparations used in medicines, dosage and general influence
upon the animal economy.

peutics is the intelligent application of agents and methods to the
cure or alleviation of disease.

Specific Therapeutics is a term adopted to specify the adaptation of each
remedy in the most direct manner, in accordance with its selective action upon
any organ or part, for the restoration of that organ or part to health.

P y or Pharmacognosy is the science of drugs, and the science and
art of the preparation and dispensing of the remedies which are to be administered by the physician for the cure of disease.

The great essential objective underlying American activities in all lines of
their exercise, is definite accomplishment—achievement. This object has certainly had its fulfillment in our profession, during the last three or four decades.
Probably in no other line of activity has more been attained. This advancement, however, has been largely confined to the surgical branches of the profession, and to the microscopic and biologic fields. To too large a degree altogether, has the clinical study of Materia Medicia and Therapeutics been
neglected.

In making this statement in my first introduction, I was optimistic in believing that we were at the end of such a period, but now after seventeen years
have passed it can be said that there has been but little if any advancement in
therapeutics for more than the decade just passed, and this advancement has
not been orderly and rational as such advancement should be.

HARMONY BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONAL ACTION OF ORGANS OF THE BODY
AND THE THERAPEUTIC ACTION OF ORGANIC DRUGS.

There are lines of systematic, rational, and consistent study of the action
of drugs upon disease, that seem to me to have been clearly established by physical law, in harmony with the natural operations—the normal functional activities—of the human body, and until we confine our estimate of medicinal action
to these lines, and apply it consistently with the innate vital activites within
the system, we cannot, I think, establish a rational system of medicine. This
harmony must be studied and known.

In the study of this essentially basic and consequently vital and important
branch of medical science, the entire trend of the profession at large seems to be
towards the use of scientific measures and the adoption and establishment of
laboratory facts, as basic facts, but highly essential as these are, the truth as to
precisely how a drug acts upon a disease condition, or how the two act or react upon each other, is determined only at the bedside. It is only determined
by watching its influence upon the individual patient when the remedy is given
alone, uninfluenced by appled or induced conditions.

DISEASE ENTITY.

_For a century or more, it has been the effort of the profession to make an
entity of every disease. One of the best if not the best known therapeutic and

32 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

medical writer of the present day, once said that he lost irrecoverably the first
years of his professional life in searching for entities—in endeavoring to cure
diseases as a whole. Every disease is made up of so many factors, without regard, in full part, to the t totality of the disease, or to the definite syndrome
composing it, that even the best of these who have previously sought for the
entity, have had it forced upon them that the conditions definitely diagnosed
and specifically treated, yield results that can be secured in but very few cases,
by treating the disease as a whole.

It would certainly be a desirable accomplishment if we could subscribe to
the established method of pathologic nomenclature, and brand immediately and
with certainty, the aggregate of the symptoms of each disease, but we have it
forced upon us, that this knowledge is secondary. A quick and correct determination of the importance of each individual perversion apparent is the primary
knowledge that we must have, and this, by careful training, becomes intuitive
to a certain extent, and consequently reliable. When we have so trained ourselves that we can depend upon this intuitive determination of conditions, we
find that accuracy in diagnosis is a simple thing, and that recognition of the
aggregate group is an immediate and natural sequence. Such accuracy is
artistic, and anything else is indefinite, unreliable, and inexcusable.

DETERMINATION OF THE REAL TRUTH.

As I shall say elsewhere, it then becomes obligatory upon us to determine
the truth in direct specific drug action, to prove the truth, and then to teach
others that which we have learned, in applying the truth for the cure of disease. To do this, we must accept the truth from any possible source, and we
must be willing to impart this to all others, realizing that it belongs to every
members of the profession at large. These truths are so essential—they are
woven so completely into the web and woof of the physical life of all individuals that they become divine truths, essential to health and to the prolongation of human life.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF DOUBT AND OF FAITH.

The most deplorable thing in the study and exercise of therapeutics of the
past, is the doubt that seems to be a fashionable part of the expression of
every writer on this subject. This is indeed deplorable. It is dangerous. It
is harmful in the extreme, and it has done more towards preventing therapeutic advancement than any other one thing. Doubt has but little place in
this important study. Doubt induces pessimism; paralyzes effort and energy;
conduces to uncertainty; and thus often leads to results that could not be
classed other than criminal. The unfavorable results in drug application from
ignorance, or even a failure to cure disease because of lack of knowledge are
inexcusable, and we may well say criminal.

While doubt is deplorable, faith is absolutely essential. It makes the prescriber strong, resolute, certain. It establishes confidence on the part of the
patient, and materially promotes the results desired from the remedy. Its
psychic influence is of the most vital importance. Faith brings hope, where
doubt leads only to despondency and despair.

THE CORRECT METHOD OF STUDY.

The true method of study of the clinical action of any drug, is to study it
alone. When once so learned, it can be applied in proper combination with
others. We now all accept the fact that each drug acts directly and invariably
upon one or more exact conditions of disease, and must be so studied and known.

GENERAL THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS AND DEFINITION 33

Having once perfected such a knowledge, we find our powers materially increased. We find that we can immediately and successfully prescribe for many
conditions of disease which previously we had thought incurable.

THE SOURCES OF TRUTH IN THERAPEUTICS.

All this has been practiced in the last three or four decades by physicians
out in the field, quiet and unassuming in their outside influence, perhaps unknown outside of the limits of their own practice. The sum of our knowledge
is made up of the best things not only from those who are called the best
doctors, but splendid things from these quiet unassuming doctors, and successful measures of the individual practitioners of all schools. This has become
common property. Some of the wisest have caught hints from eminently irregular sources, and these hints have proven good and have been put into scientific
form and have been added to the sum of general knowledge. We have found
gems of truth scattered throughout the methods of all practice whatever taught,
of whatever creed. These gems have become common property; all of us feel
that we have claims upon them. These have been placed by repeated experiences and correct observations into an exact place in therapeutics. All have
become systematized and scientific, until now the Specific method of drug application has grown and developed, until it is accepted in part or in the whole
by a large proportion of the total profession of whatever school and its adoption
is destined to become general.

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PHYSICIAN.

When a physician assumes the charge of a patient ill from any disorder,
definite or indefinite, he assumes the greatest responsibility that a man can take
upon himself. He takes into his own hands the life of that patient, and he is
responsible to God for that life. If he feels any less responsibility than this,
he should refuse to assume control of the case. If he feels that his knowledge
is insufficient, he should forget every prejudice; every opposing sentiment, and
enter at once with diligence into securing correct knowledge from whatever
source.

LACK OF KNOWLEDGE INEXCUSABLE.

There was a time when lack of knowledge of drug application and drug
action was, perhaps, excusable. It is so no more. It is now no less than criminal, and if human law does not punish it, devine law surely will.

A man now standing in a high position in medical circles in Chicago, once
told the writer that there was no definite curative action of drugs that was not
generally known; that if disease could not be cured with the knowledge that
was then common knowledge, it was incurable. This is in line with statements
made in the very latest works on Materia Medica from certain writers, that no
physician is excusable for prescribing any medicine whatever, until he has
formed a correct conclusion as to the exact diagnosis of the total condition.
There is no greater fallacy known today, than this.

FIRST OBSERVATIONS IN DIAGNOSIS, AND THEIR TREATMENT.

The first glance of an observing physician determines that fever perhaps
exists; or that the nervous system is irritated unduly; or that there is a shock
to the vital forces; and that the heart’s action is oppressed, and the circulation impeded, or that the respiration is interfered with. Anyone of these appeals immediately to the prescriber looking for indications, and a remedy is at
once dispensed in accordance with these demands, meeting the most important

of the symptoms first. He can make no mistake in this if he prescribes carefully. He can then go on and determine, if he choose, the total syndrome and
name the disease. If he has prescribed accurately for these leading conditions,
though he may fail at that time in naming the disease, he may find on his return that the patient has recovered. A fire had been kindled but he promptly
extinguished it. Consequently no subsequent harm was done. This course is a
safe one to consider in any prescribing.

In the total study of disease invasion in any one patient, the first essential
thing to know, is the cause, but as stated, the prescriber cannot wait always to
determine this, before he prescribes. When determined it must be removed.

Another important thing which he must have in mind is to support the
inherent vital powers of the patient—to conserve these. In many cases, as in
the parturient woman, in severe traumatism and when surgical measures are
necessary for therapeutic results, everything must be done to prevent shock.
This was the first basic principle ‘of the Eclectic school of medicine.

The second essential is perfect internal and external asepsis, the elimination of morbific products, and the thorough cleansing of the internal channels
of the body.

Third. As we have stated, the conspicuous symptoms must have specific drug
application at once. Often the first indication is pain. This produces a shock
to the system and usually materially retards the action of drugs in the same
proportion as it antagonizes the anodynes that are given for its relief. These
symptoms may produce organic change rapidly, and must therefore be immediately relieved. Nothing that annoys, disturbs, or distresses the patient, must
go without consideration. This demands the use of sedatives and soothing
remedies in conjunction with curative agents.

Fourth. The adjustment of nourishment and the determination of the
proper quantity, little or more, according to the ability of the patient to appropriate it.

Among the indications for first thought, temperature is very important. If
there is shock, the temperature will be usually subnormal, and must be at once
brought up to normal, by heat or stimulants. This absolutely must not be
neglected. If immediate surgical operation is demanded, heat must be applied
from the first, and for hours after the operation until the temperature is easily
at the normal point.

If the temperature is elevated, no excuse that any writer has ever brought
has ever been sufficient to prove that harm can be done by carefully reducing
the temperature to normal. The harm that is attributed to this, is brought
about by the too free use of antipyretics that are irrational, unnatural in their
action, and are given in too large doses. We have rational antipyretics that
should aways be selected and used with judgment and discretion at once,
whenever the temperature is exalted.

In watching for the effect of the remedy prescribed upon the condition
involved, the dosage of the remedy or the intervals between the doses may be

according to the abatement or increase of the symptoms.

Closely watching any possible occurrence of some complicating condition,
it must be recognized and met with the specific remedy the moment it occurs.
These occur so insidiously sometimes, that they have a strong grasp upon the
system when recognized. They may occur from continuing the previous specific Hon too long, after its indications have abated. This also must be
considered.

AS THE REMEDIES ACT.

It has been found by investigating the action of drugs—by a close study of
their influence upon the animal body, that no one remedy influences the entire

organism in a regular, certain and direct manner in disease, consistent with the
normal action of each organ or part; but that each one, in accordance with some
inherent law not well understood, influences in a definite manner some organ or
part, and that this influence can be directed and controlled by the intelligent
prescriber for the accomplishment of one of several important results.

First; it directly destroys or removes the causes of disease, and where perversion of the function is not permanent, or where structural change has not
taken place to too great an extent, it permits the organ or part to resume its
normal functional activity in accordance with inherent natural tendencies, in
the performance of its normal functional operations.

Second; it may remove or cause the removal of obstructions to the performance of the health function of an organ. It may cause the absorption of
plastic deposits or other results of inflammatory action.

Third; it may increase the inherent power of the organ to throw off the
influences of disease action, and to reassume the normal function of health,
otherwise unassisted.

Fourth; it may cause some other function or organ of the body to exercise
a direct influence upon the disease processes at work upon that organ, in such
a@ manner as to stay those processes and permit the normal conditions of the
organ to reassert themselves. This power is inherent in, and is observed in the
action of the hormones. It is exercised interchangably by the endocrinic glands
in sustaining the fine hormone balance of perfect health.

Fifth; it may supply deficient chemical constituents—essential constructive material—protoplasmic pabulum—neutritive elements—directly to the
part, and thus enable it to assume its normal condition.

ADMINISTRATION OF REMEDIES.

In the administration of therapeutic measures, the method suggested by
experience as best adapted to securing the full effects of the measure is adopted:

First; they are given properly prepared, by the mouth in order that they
shall be received in the stomach and shall be directly appropriated.

Second; they may be given beneath the skin by subcutaneous or hypodermatic introduction. These may be introduced into the skin, into the cellular
tissues beneath the skin, into the deep muscular structures, or into immediate
contact with the nerves, directly into an organ, or immediately into the blood
stream.

Third; by the rectum. This course is forced upon the prescriber occasionally when the stomach passages are occluded, or when the condition of the
stomach is such as to refuse the agent, or when objectionable conditions are induced by the presence of the agent in the stomach.

Fourth; by inhalation. While this method has been frequently resorted to
in the past, the author believes that there is a future in this beyond our present
accomplishment.

Fifth; by inunction. This is a simple method especially advised in the
treatment of infants and the syphilitic.

Sixth; by fumigation. This method has a narrow field, but it is important
in the field.

Seventh; by cataphoresis. This is accomplished through the action of electricity in conveying the active principles of the medicine into the system. It
is not in general use.

Before hypodermics were in such common use, there was another method
called the endermic method. By the use of a caustic, such as concentrated ammonia or by a blister, the skin was removed, and a medicine in the form of an
absorbent powder was applied to the raw surface. This method is so seldom

used at the present time, that it may well be called obsolete. This method might
be forced to include the absorption of the medicinal principles of plasters. This
was once counted an important method of treatment, and in certain cases it has
been very useful. It is not now widely adopted.

AUXILIARY THERAPEUTIC MEASURES.

In addition to the use of medicines, auxiliary therapeutic measures are now
generally adopted, each in its own specific field, as all have their limitations.
These are of greater or less importance and each must be studied and practiced
with reference to its own definite action. Among the more common of these are
the following:

HYDROTHERAPY.

The use of water and its adaptation in various forms externally and internally in the treatment of disease.

THERMOTHERAPY.

The application of heat by various means, either locally or generally in
the treatment of disease.
PHOTOTHERAPY.

The application of light, either the direct sunlight, artificial light, various
colored lights—chromo therapy—or electric light in the treatment of disease.

BALNEOTHERAPY.

The science of bathing and baths in all their forms and in all its applications to diseased conditions.

RADIOTHERAPY.

The application of the Roéntgen rays or other forms of radio-activity in
the treatment of disease. This measure would naturally include the use of
radium as a therapeutic agent, but some writers class radium as an independent agent and its use as radium therapy.

ELECTROTHERAPY.

The application of electricity in its multiple forms and by the various
methods of application in the cure of disease. This involves to a certain extent the use of water, the use of heat, and the influence of electric heat also
in conjunction with electrie light.

MECHANOTHERAPY.

The treatment of disease by mechanical apparatus or by systematic
forced movements, which in limited part, may be made by an assistant without mechanical means.

MASSAGE OR MASSOTHERAPY.

The treatment of the superficial parts of the body by rubbing, stroking,
kneading, or tapping either with hand or instrument, either for remedial or
hygienic purposes.

PSYCHOTHERAPY.

The treatment of subjective conditions of disease by influences exercised
by operation upon or through the mind of the patient, as by suggestion.

GENERAL THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS AND DEFINITION 37

SERUM THERAPY.

The use of the various blood serums either from animals naturally immune to infectious disease, or from animals rendered immune by the introduction of toxins. This promises to become one of the important branches
of therapeutics, if not already so.

SWEDISH MOVEMENT.

(Kinesiastrics); a system of exercises, both active and passive involving
the different muscles, and joints of the body, probably included to an extent
in massotherapy.

OSTEOTHERAPY OR OSTEOPATHY.

The treatment of disease which is based on the theory that many diseases are caused by a deranged mechanism of the various structures of the
body, such as the bones, nerves, blood vessels, and tissues, which may be
corrected by manipulations calculated to restore these parts to strictly normal
relations and function.

SPONDYLOTHERAPY.

A treatment of disease based on the theory that disease of the vertebre
or mal-positions, or deflexions of these bones, exercise a pathologic influence
upon the structure of the spinal cord or upon its nerves or ganglia in such a
manner as to induce disease of remote organs or parts—reflex derangement—
and that proper manipulation of the vertebra or proper treatment directed
to overcoming the faults named, will result in a cure of the diseased
conditions.

ORIFICIAL SURGERY.

The treatment of diseases caused reflexly by pathologic conditions involving the various orifices of the body. The restoration of nerve structures
of the orifices to a normal condition—the removal of abnormal conditions—
results so frequently in prompt and satisfactory relief of some prominent
remote disease involving the nervous system, that the correctness of the
theory in general is proven. The details need to be perfected.

SERUM THERAPY AND ANTITOXINS.

A natural antidote for any infectious disease is something to be greatly
desired. For several years investigations have been carried out in order to
secure such an antidote for a number of the well known infections. Theoretically, that should be readily obtained. Practically only one so far is
sufficiently reliable to make its application general. This is the diphtheria
antitoxin.

A horse is naturally immune to the infection of diphtheria. By a method
which we have not room to explain which is accounted for in accordance
with the hypothesis of Ehrlich, which is known as the side chain theory, the
serum of the horse is charged with a toxin from cultures made from diphtheria germs. This makes it possible for the serum of the blood so charged,
which is already normally able to resist the diphtheria poison, to exercise the
same influence temporarily upon any other animal, if it be injected into the
body of that animal.

The theory for the entire process is exceedingly interesting, and seems
to be rational. Whether it will be found sufficiently practical to come into
general use, time alone will determine. It is difficult for anyone uninformed
to understand how a virulent toxin originally obtained from the highly infectious germs of diphtheria can be safely injected into the pure blood of a
little child, and preserve that child from further infection by the original
germ. For this reason there has been much hesitation in the general adoption of such a method. There is no doubt, whatever, that the mortality from
diphtheria has been materially reduced since the general adoption of this
antitoxin, and this fact stands against all argument.

Notwithstanding this, we are confident that with our own methods we
have equally successful measures, especially since we have learned that lobelia hypodermically acts clinically, almost precisely as the antitoxin of diphtheria does upon the infection. But entirely unlike that of diphtheria, it supports every vital force within the system, encourages the normal process of
the body in a most natural and rational manner, and does not introduce anything foreign, abnormal, or in any way detrimental to the vital processes
within the system.

The diphtheria antitoxin, as is well known, produces a condition in the
system of many individuals known as anaphylaxis, which makes the individual susceptible at a future time if it becomes necessary to use the antitoxin,
to the antitoxin itself; a fatal result having occurred in many cases, not from
the diphtheria which was present, but from the untoward influence of the

With lobelia exactly the opposite takes place. The agent renders the
system stronger to resist future infections. At the same time if administered
in a full dose during this anaphylactic period, it quickly restores the patient
and destroys the infective constituents to blame for the existing condition.
It is to be hoped that the entire profession will make a thorough investigation of this remedy as a natural successor in all of its influence to the diphtheria antitoxin. We believe after ten years of careful observation, that it
will be found to meet the requirements in a very simple and natural manner.

VACCINES AND VACCINE THERAPY 39
VACCINES AND VACOINE THERAPY.

Vaccination, as has been understood for nearly a hundred years, consists
in the introduction into the circulation of a patient, of the virus of cow-pox,
in order to render that patient, exposed to small-pox, immune to that disease.
The virus so introduced contains the living germs.

Vaccine therapy as now understood is almost diametrically the opposite
of this process. It introduces those germs dead, which if alive, active, and
virulent, induce the identical disease which they are expected under these circumstances, to prevent or cure. The theory is that in this we supply to the
system by the questionable method of introducing these dead toxic germs, a
stimulus by which the body may assist in its own protection or defense. It
at once, then, becomes plain that there is a wide difference between antitoxin
or serum therapy and vaccine therapy. In the former, a preventive agent is
introduced into the system, which has been made so by the inherent immunizing power of another healthy animal. In the latter case, the immunizing
agent must be developed within the system which it is expected to protect.

Serum therapy is thus more rational than the present vaccine therapy.
It is infinitely more practical also because in the latter, so many conditions
are likely to be present, that will prevent the system from developing its own
immunity; or there may be many different kinds of germs present in addition to the one which is used to produce this immunity; or it is such a simple
thing for the prescriber to make a mistake in determining whether he shall
use a univalent, or a mixed vaccine; whether he is able to secure an autogenous vaccine or whether he is obliged to depend upon a stock vaccine. For
these and other very important reasons none of the vaccines have as yet come
into general use.

The typhoid vaccine therapy is most commonly used, but the evidences
do not show that it shortens the period of the disease. It seems in many cases
however to modify the severity of the disease processes. It promises well as
a prophylactic.

It would seem natural to believe that in a course of a long period of careful investigation and accurate estimation of all the conditions involved, and
the avoidance of the shot-gun method of the use of stock vaccines, there will
yet be much improvement in this method of therapy, and practical results
should be obtained without danger to the patient.

The pronounced success of vaccination for small-pox should encourage
us to hope for such a result. At the same time the failures or disappointments
in the present investigation of vaccine therapy, as now applied, should not
in any way lessen our perfect confidence in the use of the virus of the cowpox properly prepared, in the prevention of small-pox.

THE HORMONES.

The Hormones are a class of remedies extracted from the various ductless
glands of the animal body At the Italian Congress of Medicine in October,
1912, there was an official report as to the secretions of and the influence
of these glands upon the system in health and disease. All glands having
an internal secretion were called Endocrinie glands, and the system of
glands was called the Endocrinic system. Starling in 1907 states that the
secretions from these glands are discharged directly into the blood stream,
and carried onward by these to the organ on which they exercise their specific
effect. They cannot therefore belong to the complex bodies which include
the toxins of animal and vegetable origin. He believes that they are produced in the normal metabolism of cell structure and are of definite chemical
composition, and are comparable in their nature and mode of action to drugs
of specific influence, such as the alkaloids. In consequence of the distinctive
features of this class of bodies and the important functions played by them
in the higher organisms, he gave them the name of Hormones from ‘‘I arouse
or excite.’’

These secretions seem to have the power to correlate and coordinate the
various body functions, in a subtle, peculiar and exceedingly important manner. At the same time they destroy toxins within the system, and sustain
each other in the exercise each of its individual influence. The balance resulting from this interaction is called the hormone balance, and when properly sustained, the functions of the body are found cooperating with each
other in a normal manner, which results in perfect health.

The active principle which is thought to represent the influence of the
gland has been separated with the larger number of them. Secretin is obtained from the walls of the duodenum. This agent seems to stimulate the
pancreatic glands, increasing their activity. An increase of the pancreatic
secretion causes an increase in the combustion of the carbo-hydrates, and
when this result is deficient, sugar is eliminated through the kidneys, and
we have the disease known as Diabetes Mellitus.

A number of investigators, a few years ago following the suggestions
of Brown-Sequard and others prepared extracts from the thyroids, parathyroids, ovaries, testicles, pituitaries, and from actual brain and nerve structure, and have given them, somewhat indiscriminately, to regulate the functional operations in general conditions of disease, especially where the cells
were degenerate, inactive, or totally destroyed.

An assistance to investigation was the fact that it has been observed
in several cases where abnormal development of the external genital organs
and early maturity, have occurred in children, there have been tumors or abnormal growths of the supra-renal gland.

Experimenting with an extract of these glands, a very wide range of
influence has has been observed. It is used in the treatment of asthma,
whooping cough, and cardiac dyspnea; also in the vomiting of pregnancy
and in the treatment of exophthalmic goiter, the latter with excellent results
a certain bad cases; in toxemias, Addison’s disease, and capillary hemorrhage.

The Thyroid Extract seems to be the most important one, exercising a
general regulating influence, especially over the mechanism of the organs
of nutrition, growth, and development. Its influence has produced in
Graves’ disease emaciation, hunger, thirst, polyuria, diarrhea, vomiting, profuse sweating, nervous symptoms, tachycardia, increased blood pressure. On
the other hand, it has materially benefited those conditions depending upon

THE HORMONES 41

insufficiency of the thyroid glands. Obesity, mental insufficiency, and
myxedema have been cured with it.

It is thought that this agent antagonizes the Pancreatic Glands in their
influence as glycosuria has occurred from overdoses. It certainly increases
blood pressure notwithstanding other theories to the contrary if the heart
is intact. It must not be given where with feeble heart there is high blood
pressure. This agent should not be used in tubercular patients. There is
a consensus of opinion in favor of this statement.

Where there is deficient secretion of these glands there is a tendency to
forgetfulness, sleeplessness, restlessness, sluggishness, neglect of routine
duties, general dullness. These conditions in children lead to cretinism, slow
growth, eczema, infantile obesity, chlorosis, amenorrhea, epilepsy, hysteria,
and melancholia.

The field of action of the Pituitary Gland is a wide one. It controls the
various functions of the body, and exercises a superior control over the
growth and development of the sexual organs, being intimately related to
the function of the other endocrinic glands. The symptom complex of hypoeee is very similar to that of deficient action of the thyroid or thymus
glands.

It is thought that over secretion of this gland contributes as a cause
to diabetes mellitus. There is one extract secreted by the pituitary gland
that causes diuresis, strengthens the contractions of the bladder, uterus,
intestines, stomach, gall-bladder, and bronchial muscles, dilates the pupils,
causes prompt bowel movements by stimulating the muscular activity. It
overcomes uterine inertia.

The interrelation between this gland and the Thyroid Gland has been
shown by post mortum appearances where the thyroid gland had been removed some time before death. There was enlargement of the pituitary
body, a deposit of colloid substance, and increase of hyaline bodies.

An extract of the pituitary gland is now in general use. Many claim excellent results from it as an oxytocic. On the other hand, very many disclaim beneficial influences and declare it to be a dangerous agent. Unlike
ergot, macrotys, and other vegetable stimulants to uterine contraction, it can
not be continuously given, as it acts upon the structures of the arteries. Its
influence in inducing labor pains is antagonized by chloroform and morphine. It has been used in overcoming shock.

A number of writers advocate the theory that the pancreatic secretion,
that of the adrenals, thyroid, parathyroid, and pituitary bodies have a
marked influence on carbo-hydrate metabolism. This was proven to an extent by a post mortum on a patient who had died of diabetes, showing that
the pancreas was reduced in weight; there was edema of the thyroid; the
pineal gland was loaded with colloid drops; the supra-renal glands were
spongiocytotic, and the ovaries greatly atrophied.

In addition to these influences are those of the ovarian secretion, of the
corpus luteum, and of the thymus gland, as well as those of the prostate
gland, the mesentery gland, and the carotid gland. Some very interesting
facts are being brought out with each of these. The entire study of this
whole system is now at such an early stage, that no prophesy can be made
as to what the future will develop concerning them. That it is a fertile field
seems plainly evident.

THE ALCRESTA REAGENT.

Early in the year 1911, Professor John Uri Lloyd, at work in his laboratory in Cincinnati, made the highly important discovery that a form of the
hydrated aluminum silicate, obtainable from clay and certain earths, especially from Fuller’s earth, possessed a most marked affinity for the alkaloids,
when it is in combination with water. This reagent when brought into a
colloidal condition has its affinity for alkaloids and alkaloidal salts intensified, being almost instantaneous in its action in the separation of any alkaloid
so far investigated.

After so separating the alkaloid, this can be liberated from its affinity
to the reagent by treatment with a base, and an alkaloid solvent. Another
important fact concerning this separation is that with bitter alkaloids the bitterness disappears without in any way interfering with the properties of the
alkaloid, as at present observed. The purity of the alkaloids obtained by
this method is remarkable. The fact that their activity is in no way decreased
and that the bitterness is removed puts this discovery in line with other great
discoveries made by Professor Lloyd, as probably the most important made in
Pharmacy in many years.

The method of separating the alkaloids has in the past been a roundabout and tedious method, laborious and often uncertain. Prof. Lloyd told me
years ago, that the processes must be simplified, as he feared that some of the socalled alkaloids were the product of the reactions that took place in their
chemical separation.

He has been experimenting for a long period to find a substance which
would act as a more satisfactory reagent, from which there would be no
change in the true alkaloid. Such a substance he has succeeded in finding.
He has named this substance Alcresta.

This reagent acting as above described serves an excellent purpose as
an antidote to alkaloids taken into the system. Dr. Fantus has showed that
the reagent alone imperfectly antidotes strychnine, but the addition or tartaric acid makes it markedly effective.

Its antidotal value on morphine is distinctly marked. It antidotes cocaine fully, if morphine be given hypodermically to retard the passage from
the stomach to the intestine. Nicotine acts too quickly to be antidoted unless the reagent is swallowed immediately, when it is a partial antidote.
Ipecac is powerfully antidoted. Aconite imperfectly so.

So short a time is it, since this reagent was given to the public, that but
very little of its full value has been determined. If it does no more than to
give the profession a tasteless quinine with full properties, it will serve a most
useful purpose. A suggestion of its usefulness is made by the very sudden
popularity of Alcresta Ipecac (page 248) which is found to carry the therapeutie properties of emetine with few if any objectionable features.

THE BIOCHEMIC SYSTEM OF SCHUESSLER 43

THE BIOCHEMIO SYSTEM OF SCHUESSLER.

Synonyms—Tissue Remedies. Schuessler’s Remedies.

Among the theories that have been advanced for the action of remedies
in the cure of disease, for a complete system of medicine, probably the
simplest and the one that theoretically would seem to be rational, is that of
Schuessler of Oldensburg, Germany. He made investigation into the action
of the chemical principles of the human body and decided that twelve earthy
compounds were involved in the structure of the body, and that disease was
caused by an unbalance in the quantity of these compounds. A deficiency
in any one would cause a train of symptoms of disease which would be relieved by supplying that substance medicinally prepared and administered.
These twelve inorganic remedies are called the tissue remedies of Schuessler, or
the biochemic remedies.

While but very few, if any, physicians accept Schuessler’s dictum that
all diseases can be cured by the proper adjustment of these remedies, very
many believe that certain of these remedies are very effective, each in the
field that Schuessler assigned to it, broadened perhaps by subsequent investigation. As Schuessler belonged to the Homeopathic school, his remedies have
the Homeopathic nomenclature. They are as follows:

Phosphate of Iron—Ferrum Phos.
Phosphate of Calcium—Calcaria Phos.
Phosphate of Sodium—Natrium Phos.
Phosphate of Potassium—Kali Phos.
Chloride of Potassium—Kali Mur.
Chloride of Sodium—Natrium Mur.
Fluoride of Caleium—Calearia Fluor.
Silicea—Silicer.

Sulphate of Calcium—Calcaria Sulph.
Sulphate of Sodium—Natrium Sulph.
Sulphate of Potassium—Kali Sulph.
Phosphate of Magnesium—Magnesium Phos.

The following is a condensed statement of the theory concerning those
structures in the body that are supplied by each remedy; the conditions to
which they seem applicable and the method of their administration. All of
these preperations are supplied in the form of Homeopathic triturates. Various attenuations have been tried, but the third and sixth decimal are those
that seem to yield the best results. The trituration is made in order that
the remedy may be supplied in the best possible form for immediate appropriation, and that the best results shall be secured from the smallest possible
quantity.

FERRUM PHOSPHORICUM.

Phosphate of Iron—Ferrum Phos. Iron is found in the hemoglobin.
The quantity in the blood is supposed to be about forty grains for 150 pounds
of the body weight. Albumin contains iron, and the iron of the blood contributes to the oxygen carrying power of the blood. Schuessler’s theories do
not explain the influence of the phosphorus in union with the iron.

They claim the field of action of the remedy to be those conditions
which accompany local inflammation with increased temperature. It is given

for all febrile disturbances, and the more abrupt and violent, the more
marked the influence of the agent. It is given at the onset of the inflammation before exudation begins. It is also given in anemia and the marasmus
of children. It is useful in neurasthenia, but must be persisted in.

Boericke and Dewey’s 1914 edition of the tissue remedies gives the indications as follows: With inflammations, pains that are worse from motion and better from cold; hemorrhages caused by hyperemia; fresh wounds
from mechanical injuries. I have used this remedy a great deal and have
been satisfied that it has a place in the control of acute fevers, and in certain
inflammations, especially those of the lungs. These agents are all perfectly
safe and can be given freely.

POTASSIUM CHLORIDUM.

Chloride of Potassium, Kali Mur., should be prescribed early in inflammations to prevent plastic exudations. It is indicated where there is a
white or gray coat on the tongue or on the mucous membranes of the mouth
or throat, a thick white slime; where the skin is scaly, mucous membranes
pale; and where there are vesicles, ulcers, and erosions.

It prevents exudates in pneumonia and other inflammations of the respiratory tract. It is advisable in diphtheria, croup, and in cellulitis, hepatitis, and appendicitis.

This salt is found in the blood corpuscles, muscles, and nerve cells; also
in the intercellular fluids.

°

POTASSIUM PHOSPHORICUM.

Phosphate of Potassium, Kali Phos., is an element of the tissue forming
substances. All nutritious fluids contain it. It represents the correct formation of tissues and fluids, especially those of the brain, nerve, muscle, and
blood cells. When this substance is deficient, the condition is similar to that
induced by low fevers and nervous exhaustion.

The direct indication for its use is brain fag, irritability, nervousness,
depression of spirits, hysteria, melancholia. The symptoms for the remedy
represent those for pulsatilla, including a tendency towards insanity or
paralysis. When the tongue is coated brown, the breath offensive, it is especially indicated. Neurasthenia furnishes a wide field for its influence.

POTASSIUM SULPHURIOUM.

Sulphate of Potassium—Kali Sulph.—supplies the epidermis and epithelium. This includes the skin and mucous membranes and their diseases, especially those characterized by yellowish discharges. The tongue indications
for the remedy are that it is coated with a slimy yellow coating; that there
are thin, yellow or yellowish-green discharges from the mucous membranes;
that there are scaly desquamations from these membranes or from the skin.
It is supposed to be one of the oxygen carriers of the system. It is indicated
when the patient feels better in the open air, worse in a closed room, or

THE BIOCHEMIC SYSTEM OF SCHUESSLER 45

where the patient is restless and cannot get his breath fully, where there is
a suffocating feeling and a desire for fresh air.

MAGNESIUM PHOSPHORICUM.

Phosphate of Magnesium—Magnesium Phos.—an important remedy, one
that I myself have found satisfactory, is found in the muscles, in the brain
and bone, in the nerves and teeth, and in the blood corpuscles. It acts more
directly on the white nerve fibers. It is especially curative in its influence
upon irritation of the nerve filaments in those conditions which result in
spasm. It is a typical antispasmodic; at the same time it has an active control over the nerve filaments in neuritis and other conditions where there is
intense pain from nerve irritation. I have just now quickly relieved a long
standing case of pruritis vulve of a most aggravated type which was instituted many years before by rhus poisoning. This condition was shortly
cured, but the pruritis was so great as to resemble a neuritis.

The influence of this agent with a nerve sedative was immediate and
seems to be permanent. It served an admirable purpose for me in one case
of acute neuritis from cold that had baffled specialists of reputation. It is |
indicated in all sharp, cutting, lancinating pains, convulsions, and in neuralgias, especially those that are relieved by heat and increased by cold.

NATRIUM CHLORIDUM.

Sodium Chloride or Natrium Mur., as is well known, is responsible for
the osmotic processes within the system. It has to do with the appropriation
and elimination of water.

The first indication is watery discharges. These are found in choleraic
conditions in certain forms of fevers. It is usually accompanied with a
frothy, slimy coat on the tongue. It does not have a wide field of action,
and is probably one of the least important of the remedies. Where there is
an inclination to vesicles, to watery contents, or where there is watery vomiting, it is useful.

NATRIUM PHOSPHORICUM.

Sodium Phosphate or Natrium Phos. is found in the blood, muscles,
nerve, and brain cells, and in the intercellular tissues. It is thought to absorb carbonic acid, supplying oxygen from this molecule which is carried
into the blood stream. This is used as a remedy for certain enlarged glands
if accompanied with sour stomach, or prevailing acid condition within the
system, especially if there be a water brash. It is useful in eczema where
there is an acid condition within the system with yellow secretion. I have
found this’substance useful in chronic disease of the liver, and it will probably be more serviceable where abnormal action of this organ has to do with
the disease, as a cause.

NATRIUM SULPHURICUM.

Sulphate of Sodium or Natrium Sulph. is found in the intercellular tissues, but not in the cells. It influences the elimination of the water which
results from retrograde metamorphosis. It excites the secretion of the intes-

tines, stimulates the activity of the intestinal glands, liver and pancreas, and
is a valuable remedy in combating the uric acid diathesis.

It is indicated if there is greenish-gray coat at the base of the tongue,
with a bitter taste in the mouth, cutting pains in the liver with enlargement,
diarrhea with dark green stools, biliousness, diabetes, the urine with high
specific gravity from urates and uric acid. From this condition there is a
long train of symptoms that nearly all experienced physicians are familiar
with: skin disorders, deficient general secretion, local irritations, and general
rheumatic tendencies.

SILICEA.

Silicea is found in the hair, nails, skin, and in the connective tissues of
the bones as well as in the periosteum; also in neurolemmia. The remedy acts upon the organic substances of the body, involving the bones, joints,
glands, skin, mucous membranes. It is especially indicated if with disease
of these structures, there is pus formation within the connective tissue.
Where there is a tendency for a part inflamed to suppurate, it promotes suppuration and hastens the process, encouraging the healing of wounds by nor_mal granulation.

Induration is overcome by it. It is especially advisable in chronic conditions, fistulas, or otherwise where this character is present. In chronic inflammations of the joints, especially where the pain and disturbance is out of
proportion to the apparent inflammatory action, such as injuries of the
knees, elbows, or wrists, which remain sore and painful for a long time, in this
it is said we have a potent remedy. It also seems to act favorably on tendons, cartilage, and bones in these conditions. It is important in chronic
gouty conditions with deposits, but it must be persisted in.

OALCIUM FLUORIDE.

Fluoride of Calcium or Calcaria Fluor. is found in the enamel of teeth,
and in the outer surface of all the bones. Also in the skin, and in elastic
fiber. It may also be found in the connective tissues and in the walls of
blood vessels.

It is indicated in any disease in which there is a general relaxed condition of the elastic fibers—general relaxation. This is conspicuous in piles,
certain tumors (hematoma), and in the varicoses whether local or general.
It should be prescribed where there is mal-nutrition of the bones, rapid decay of the teeth; where with general relaxation there are indurations or exostoses. Given during pregnancy, it is said to favor easy confinement. I
have used it for that purpose with other remedies, but which of the remedies
I should credit for the very favorable condition obtained, I could not determine; probably all had some influence.

CALCIUM PHOSPHATUM.

The Phosphate of Calcium—Calcaria Phos.—is an essential constituent
in the growth, development, and nutrition of the body. This is well known to
all observers. At the present time, it is receiving more attention perhaps,
than at any other time. It gives permanency and firmness to the joints. It
is found in the teeth, in connective tissue, and in the fluids of the body, in the
blood, plasma, and corpuscles, in the saliva, gastric juice and milk. It is espe-

cially required whenever there is a waste of albumin. It contributes to the reconstruction of blood cells, promoting cell growth and encouraging the formation of new tissue. In many of these structures, it is the real nutritive principle upon which these structures depend for their nourishment, growth, and
development.

It is indicated in all disease of the bones, especially where these diseases
depend upon blood faults or where the dermoid tissues are involved with the
osseous tissues. Given during dentition in infants it seems to do away with

‘the nerve irritation, overcoming convulsions. It restores patients after acute

disease, and promotes the oxygen carrying power of the blood indirectly by
causing a proper development of the white corpuscles. In anemia, chronic
wasting disease, and in the senile conditions of old age, it will be found especially valuable. It is of great benefit in anemia, especially if given in conjunetion with Ferrum Phos.

CALCIUM SULPHATUM.

The sulphate of lime—Calcium Sulph.—or plaster of Paris is probably of
but little influence in medicine in any form. It is found in the bile, but is not
constant there. It is supposed to destroy worn out red corpuscles, thus influencing the condition of the liver. Schussler at first claimed that it stood in
close relation to suppurations, curing purulent discharges from the mucous
membranes and purulent exudates from serous membranes as well as promoting the cure of tubercular ulcers, or intestinal abscesses, or ulcers of the
cornea.

It is especially indicated, present authorities claim, where after full evacuation of pus from pus sacs, there is continuous discharge which affects the
epithelial structures. Discharging abscesses anywhere, indicate it. Schussler
ultimately discarded this remedy but recent authorities claim that it is efficacious for the conditions named.

PHARMACY AND PHARMACOGNOSY.

Joun Uri Liovp, Ph. M., Ph. D. LL. D.

Need I say that my lifetime experience in pharmacy, devoted mainly to
the study of preparations of plants, as well as to plant chemistry, which includes alkaloids, glucosides and other plant products, leads me to comprehend
more fully than otherwise I might, the honor shown me by Professor Ellingwood, who has asked me to make a contribution in these lines for his forthcoming publication? Nor can I neglect to express the satisfaction I feel, in
that the whole American medical profession, as well as the section of thoughtful pharmacists concerned in this direction, is becoming more and more impressed with the usefulness of remedial agents, prepared from the vegetable
kingdom. To this is added a growing comprehension of the fact that the study
of the pharmacy of plant organizations is a problem that needs take the utmost
thought of the scientific man, and the utmost care of the manipulative pharmacist. The pharmacy of plant preparations has passed from the hands of
the superficial experimenter, into the field of the closest scientific student, the
evolution of satisfactory plant preparations being now fully comprehended by
those experienced, as among the most difficult of all problems connected with
the satisfactory preparation of therapeutic agents.

I will further preface my remarks by saying that my lengthened experience has led me to hesitate to express myself concerning many problems in
pharmacy that, at one time, would have presented to me no cause for hesitation. To speak more plainly, expanding views, influenced and guided by
thoughtful work in pharmacy, have both widened my horizon and illuminated
the space about, until I now see defects in my past work, and errors in judgment, formerly unperceived. I believe that this condition must be true of all
men who approach the end of a life that has been devoted to any calling. Only
those who do not comprehend the subject of pharmacy, can view it otherwise
than as a mighty work, beyond the power of any one man to grasp in its
entirety. Only those who by reason of ignorance bred by inexperience are led
to underrate this great art, will presume to encroach on the field, other than
as questioners of voices from the past, or as listeners to whispers of the
present.

With these candidly expressed views, I shall proceed to speak to my
physician friends in the utmost freedom, concerning the subject before me,
assuming that they comprehend that pharmacy is not a subject any man can
hope to master by book study alone. I shall therefore endeavor to convey, as
has been requested, in as condensed a way as possible, a brief description of the
prominent classes of pharmaceutical preparations, and their relationships, confining myself practically to medicinal preparations made of plants.

In arranging these classes I shall not follow the alphabetical method, but
will group similar classes together, and thus refer to their relationships. For
example, plant preparations will be briefly followed in natural groups, the
complete lot embracing extracts, solid and fluid, tinctures, ete., ete. In like
manner, liniments, ointments, cerates and plasters are grouped, and so are
gelatine and sugar-coated pills, tablets and troches. Naturally, a few classes,
like emulsions and suppositories, are outside of any system of classification.

Crude Drugs—But in it all, I beg the reader to accept that I must be very
brief with each subject. The greatest care must be used by the pharmacist in


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 35


Jon of drug selection. A crude drug is the foundation of a pharmaeparation. Poor crude material is productive of inferior medicine,
of the care of the operator. The study of applied pharmacy conty begins with a study of drugs, and carelessness or ignorance concernoft neglected section in pharmacy is to be held accountable for much
edicine—more indeed, than is generally known.

e qualified pharmacist must not only be conversant with manipulative
ethods, but also experienced in the study of drugs. In this direction it is not
alone suffjeient to be able to distinguish between different drugs (this is useful
to guard‘against sophistication), but he must be able to judge of the intrinsic
qualities of drugs. This last is the most important part of the art of pharmacognosy, for while it is easy to learn to identify different drugs it is difficult
to obtain the experience necessary to judge of quality shades.

Thus, as an example, a pharmaceutical student can easily qualify himself
so as to be able to distinguish between Vanilla and Tonga beans, and even
to close his eyes and identify each by the odor alone, but much experience is
necessary for him to be able to differentiate between shades of quality of
Tonga and in Vanilla. The same is true of other drugs. There are many different qualities of drugs of every description, and, in my opinion, the knowledge necessary to their successful differentiation is only to be gained by patient
study and great experience in practical pharmacy.

For example: The aroma of a fine ripe peach can only be learned by personal experience with peaches. The same is true of other fruits, such as the
pineapple. Between the fully ripe and delicious peach and those inferior and
worthless, lie a chain of peaches all peaches, but yet of many qualities.

True it is that in some instances chemical tests may be employed for drug
valuations, but these cases (for example Cinchona and Opium) are so few
as to scarcely bear any comparison with the great number of drugs in which
we have absolutely no recorded method of detecting values. Hence it is that
the educations of many conscientious pharmacists are necessarily deficient in
this very important direction by reason of the fact—that in many cases they
are situated where there is so little demand for pharmaceutical preparations as
to have limited their opportunity to qualify themselves. Indeed, in my opinion,
this much to be deplored lack of facility to become personally expert, rather
than intentional disregard of duty, accounts for much defective medicine in
the line of plant preparations.

That ignorance of manipulative methods in connection with inexperience
in pharmacognosy may be productive of great harm, is evident to all thoughtful pharmacists. Those best versed in the art understand best the responsibility resting on the man who audaciously ventures to step into this field without the knowledge that comes from long drilling in practical work under the
watchful care of an experienced instructor.

And in this direction I cannot but criticise the opinion some very close
friends hold concerning the pharmacist’s calling. Neither books nor lectures
can teach pharmacy in its broadest sense. The foundation that is gained by
the fortunate possessor of a systematic college of pharmacy or university education, is not to be undervalued, but it is only a foundation for the recipient to
build upon in the future. In my opinion, no man should at this day be permitted to engage in pharmacy manipulation without a preliminary college
course of instruction in pharmacy; neither should he be allowed to practice
pharmacy by reason of college instruction alone.

Pharmacognosy—In all colleges of pharmacy, in all institutions where men
devote their lives to teaching pharmacy, this section of the art comes first, and
is considered the most difficult to master. Indeed, it is never mastered. And,
strangely enough, it may be said that by inexperienced persons, novices, this


<!-- chunk -->

PHARMACY AND PHARMACOGNOSY 61

very section is neglected or is passed as unimportant. Pharmacognosy, in the
ordinary sense of the word, is that part of pharmacy devoted to the consideration of the physical and structural qualities of drugs, but when the term is
applied to plants, I must carry the conception higher and further than a
microscopic examination of tissues or the simple identification of drugs. While
much embraced in this section of pharmacy may be learned by lecture lessons
and in book study, a great and important part of the study of pharmacognosy
can not be obtained other than by close attention in practical pharmacy manipulation.

Taste, odor, physical condition, all that experience in qualities adds to
knowledge through our senses, is a part of the work of the pharmacognosist.
It is not enough that by means of the microscope the fact be demonstrated that
the drug is true to name, the qualified pharmacist must be able to establish
whether that drug is suitable to make a reliable preparation. It may be correctly named and yet worthless.

For example, the microscope may enable the operator to assert positively
that a certain bark is wild cherry bark, but the man who decides whether the
same specimen of bark is fitted to make a reliable fluid extract of wild cherry
must be beyond the simple fact of its identity. This latter point can only be
established with certain drugs by a complete knowledge of chemical methods,
with others by the experience that comes with years, yes, a lifetime of scientific work in drugs, and in other cases still by the expertness of experience
in which no words and no diagrams are able to convey the knowledge gained
by the experienced student. Such knowledge, typical of empiricism lies outside scientific formule. To sum up, the true pharmacist must be a faithful
pharmacognosist, and must have not only the knowledge that comes from
books and instructors, from college courses with their object lessons, but, in
addition to all these, must devote years, even a lifetime, patiently to every
phase of the subject in its practical application.

Qualities of Drugs—From what has been said it will be perceived that I
can only touch in a general way on this mighty problem. When it is considered that volumes have been written in many languages, by men who have
devoted series of years to the subject of structural pharmacognosy alone, it will
be seen that I can in this space simply make an abridged statement of facts.

The quality of drugs is all important, but no general rule can be established to determine quality; neither can any man be taught this section of
pharmacy by printed lessons. The application of chemical tests is useful in a
few instances—a very few—chief among which may be cited opium, cinchona,
belladonna, ipecac, and a few other alkaloidal drugs. Then, asafetida, jalap
and a few resinous drugs may be approximately valued by their resinous constituents.

Extend the list to a limited number of glucoside yielding drugs and a few
essential oil bearers, and the list capable of chemical determination is about
exhausted. Structure, as shown by the microscope, determines authenticity
of name, not quality, as already explained. The quality of drugs must be determined through the personality of the pharmacist, the acuteness and perception of his senses, the experience gained in his labors, the drilling he receives
from his methods and the self-instruction that comes from a love of art. But
in many cases, even these are not enough, for attention must be devoted to a
study of climatic conditions, the influences which localities sometimes exert
on drug values, the season of the year in which the drug is gathered and the
time that elapses before the drug is manipulated after it is gathered. In this
direction little information is to be found in print.

My experience teaches me that some drugs must be worked green, others
partly dry, others are best when thoroughly dried, while others yet even be-

come most useful after being aged to a certain extent. Thus, as examples, only
green cactus, in my opinion, is of value. Freshly dried iris versicolor is superior to the green, and rhamnus purshiana improves by age. In some cases,
preparations of the same plant, before and after drying, have distinctly different qualities, as with tobacco. These differences in condition dependent
on environment, age, season, species, it is the duty of the pharmacist to master
so far as opportunity permits. It is the duty of physicians to uphold the
conscientious pharmacist who devotes his care in this direction.

In no sense of thoughtless criticism do I say that the indifference of some
members of the medical profession to the magnitude and importance of the
subject of pharmacology has been to me a source of pain, knowing as I do the
importance to the medical profession of this feature of our art. He who
claims to be a pharmacist and yet slights the subject of quality of drugs does
no credit to pharmacy, and the physician who belittles this great study is surely
ignorant of its intricacies and magnitude..

Crude Drugs as Remedies—The difficulty of administering crude drugs is
too well understood to require comment. Naturally the first step in an attempt
to facilitate their employment is that of comminution, or powdcring them. At
the best, powdered drugs, with their great burden of inert matters, are impractical remedies. This fact necessitated the application of manipulative
methods, the object being to exclude the objectionable parts of the crude drug
and to obtain forms of medicaments capable either of representing in small
compass large bulks of crude drugs, or of presenting the active parts in more
elegant form.

The first step in this direction, naturally, was the extracting of drugs with
hot water, infusions and decoctions being the result. But these preparations
were subject to grave objections. In the first place water is capable of abstracting but a limited part of the constituents of many active drugs, such as
fixed oils and resins. Second, it dissolves most of the gums, mucilages, inert
and objectionable constituents of plants, thus making bulky, disagreeable,
often very weak remedies. In the third place, it forms solutions that ferment
readily, becoming unreliable in a very few hours. There are other objections
to infusions and decoctions, such as the fact that volatile constituents are lost
by boiling, but these considerations need not now be mentioned.

As a sequence, the employment of alcohol menstruums soon crept into use,
thus evolving the class known as tinctures, and, at a very early day. The
separation of volatile constituents by boiling drugs with water and condensing
the steam produced a class of medicated waters. Owing to the unpleasant taste
of decoctions and infusions sugar was finally added to them, and thus the
class of syrups arose.

But these preparations are, as a rule, of little strength, or else of uncertain quality, the average dose necessarily being great, even with energetic
drugs. From a tablespoonful to a tumbler often was not unusual with such
as were destitute of toxicity.

About the beginning of this century, the necessity for more concentrated
preparations became apparent; naturally the evaporation of tinctures, decoctions and infusions resulted. The residues were usually reduced to the consistence of a stiff magma capable of being rolled into pills with or without the
addition of an excipient, and to these substances the term extract was applied.
When alcoholic tinctures were used, the term alcoholic extract was affixed.
Decoctions and infusions gave aqueous extracts, and mixtures of alcohol and
water gave hydro-alcoholic extracts. When these extracts were fully dried
and powdered, they produced the class known as powdered solid extracts.

But it became apparent to thoughtful persons that extracts often did
not, as might naturally be supposed, represent the tincture employed, and

then it was discovered that the heat applied and accompanying atmospheric
influence affected the remedial part of the remedy deleteriously, indeed even
in some cases to its utter destruction. About this time percolation was introduced into pharmacy and with this process of extraction came efforts to concentrate liquid representatives of drugs without evaporation, and to these
products the terms concentrated tinctures, saturated tinctures and fluid extracts were severally affixed. These preparations were all made with alcoholic
menstruums, and thus either of the foregoing names could be rationally applied
to this class. With their advent arose the class known as manufacturing
pharmacists, who accepted the term that struck their several fancies. Indeed,
in some cases a manufacturer even used all of them, as in the absence of
authority he could do. But gradually the terms concentrated tinctures and
essential tinctures gave way to the term fluid extract, which becoming the
official title in the Pharmacopeia, has now practically displaced the others.
Thus may be seen the natural relationships of these classes of pharmaceutical preparations and, also, briefly traced, we have the record that beginning
with crude drugs led up to their several existences.

Inasmuch as Galen first prominently introduced plants into medicine, or
at least, because he has been given great credit in this direction, plant preparations are often known as galenical preparations or galenicals, under which
term we may include all of them. Having thus introduced plant preparations
in a general way, let us give as much special attention to these several classes
as our space permits.

Infusions—These preparations are made of coarsely ground or bruised
roots, barks, herbs and seeds. They are, as a rule, prepared by pouring boiling
water over the drug, stirring the mixture occasionally, and finally straining it.
Sometimes special directions are employed as in the official infusion of Cinchona, in which cold water, aromatic sulphuric acid and percolation are used;
or infusion of wild cherry, in which cold water and percolation are employed.
However, the exceptions are limited. The following general directions of the
Pharmacopeia may be applied to the preparation of infusions generally.

An ordinary infusion, the strength of which is not directed by the
physician or specified by the Pharmacopoeia should be prepared by the
following formula:—

“Take of
The substance, coarsely comminuted, fifty grammes, 50 Gm.
Boiling water, one thousand cubic centimeters 1,000 Ce.

Water, a sufficient quantity to make one thousand cubic centimeters 1,000 Ce.

Put the substance into a suitable vessel provided with a cover, pour upon it
the boiling water, cover the vessel tightly, and let it stand for half an hour. Then
strain and pass enough water through the strainer to make the infusion measure
one thousand (1,000) cubic centimeters.

Caution—The strength of infusions of energetic or powerful substances
should be specially prescribed by the physician.’’—U. S. P.

Bear in mind that infusions are prone to ferment, and must be
repeatedly replaced by fresh ones. In my opinion, infusions of fresh plants
that contain delicate constituents are to be preferred to any preparation made
from the dry plant, and in cases where the medicinal constituent is a gum or
mucilage, insoluble in alcohol, the infusion of the dried plant is preferable to any
aleoholic preparation.
Decoctions—As a rule decoctions are made by pouring cold water over a
coarsely ground or bruised drug, the mixture being boiled for fifteen minutes,
cooled and strained. Very few exceptions are recorded, the Pharmacopeia
making but two, viz: Decoction of Cetraria and Compound decoction of Sar-

saparilla. The following general formula of the Pharmacopeia of the United
States may be applied wherever a decoction may be desired.

Decoctions—An ordinary decoction, the strength of which is not directed by
the physicians, nor specified by the Pharmacopeia, shall be prepared by the
following formula:

“Take of
The substance, coarsely comminuted, fifty grammes, 50 Gm.
Water, a sufficient quantity, —__—
To make one thousand cubic centimeters 1,000 Ce.

Put the substance into a suitable vessel provided with a cover, pour upon
it one thousand (1,000) cubic centimeters of cold water, cover it well, and
boil fifteen minutes. Then let it cool to about 40 deg. C. (104 deg. F.), express,
strain the expressed liquid, and pass enough cold water through the strainer to
make the product measure one thousand (1,000) cubic centimeters.

Caution—The strength of decoctions of energetic or powerful substances
should be specially prescribed by the physician.’’—U. S. P.

Like the infusion, decoctions ferment quickly and must be often made. It
must be remembered that while the usual strength of both decoctions and infusions is one part of drug to twenty of the finished preparation, the proportion
of all energetic (poisonous) drugs must be established by the prescribing physician, who alone has the privilege of increasing or decreasing the proportions.
At the best, however, both infusions and decoctions are deficient in drug valuation or reliability. If the aim of the physician be to administer much hot water
and little drug, or large doses of liquids of uncertain strength, they are well fitted
to their purpose. Such are the natures of teas, which in reality, as catnip, pennyroyal, etc., etc., are infusions and decoctions in which it is immaterial as to
whether or not the drug proportions be uniform.

Syrups—aAs has been said, syrups were originally infusions or decoctions
thickened with sugar. Such syrups were common in early eclectic medication,
and when derived from several drugs mixed together, were called Compound
Syrups. But about thirty years ago the fact began to be apparent that the sugar
not only diluted the liquid but weighted the remedy with useless extraneous
material, often disturbing the stomach of the afflicted person. Then it was that
many far-sighted eclectics made a crusade against the syrup craze, and as a
result practically swept these cumbersome substances out of eclectic practice.
While it is true that many syrups made by expert pharmacists are improvements
over decoctions and infusions in elegance, the fact remains that as a rule, sugar
is worse than useless in medicinal preparations, and is to be viewed as an impurity. Few sick persons relish sweets.

In a very few cases where sugar is a preservative, a syrup, is, however for
certain reasons, preferable to any other form of the remedy, and among these
may be named Syrup of Iodide of Iron, in which sugar is useful as a preventor
of chemical change. No general formula can be given for making syrups, but
individual directions may be obtained from the Dispensatories and the Pharmacopoeia..

Tinctures—This class of preparations derived its name from the fact that
they were usually of a dark color, or, at least, possessed of a characteristic color.
They are made by means of alcoholic menstruums and as a rule are of deficient
strength as compared with extracts and fluid extracts. Formerly tinctures derived from single drugs, if unofficial, were by common consent made to practically represent two ounces of drug to the pint. At present the custom seems
to warrant the proportion of one part of drug to ten parts of finished tincture.
The Pharmacopoeia and Dispensatories give special direction for making each

tincture named therein, and yet most of them are prepared by one general
method, of which the following is typical:

“Tincture of Hyoscyamus:—

Hyoscyamus in No. 60 powder, one hundred and fifty grammes, 150 Gm.
Diluted Alcohol, a sufficient quantity, to make one thousand cubic centimeters 1,000 Ce.

Moisten the powder with one hundred and fifty (150) cubic centimeters of
Diluted Alcohol, and macerate for twenty-four hours; then pack it firmly in a
eylindrical percolator, and gradually pour Diluted Alcohol upon it, until one
thousand (1,000) cubic centimeters of tincture are obtained.’’—U. S. P.

Tinctures carry all the substances, both inert and active, soluble in the
menstruum used to exhaust the drug, and are consequently prone to precipitate.
Excepting with energetic drugs, a large amount of alcohol must be administered
in order to get the full therapeutical drug effect of a tincture. Tinctures (with
few exceptions) are rapidly falling into disuse and are practically discarded in
eclecticism, where very concentrated, exact preparations of plants are now generally employed.

Fluid Extracts—These, as has been shown, are in reality concentrated tinctures, and had the Pharmacopoeia selected that term it would have been as appropriate to the class as the term fluid extract. In some directions it would have
been preferable. They are made by percolation, and carry all the constituents,
good and bad, found in tinctures. Consequently, while they are to be preferred
to tinctures, as a rule, because of their greater drug strength, they are burdened
with inert materials and valueless drug constituents. The proportion of active
constituents to those useless is surprisingly small in all fluid extracts. In my
opinion, this burden of inert extractive matter constitutes one of the great objections to fluid extracts. As is well known by eclectic physicians, this feature of the
subject has been a special study with me for many years, and papers from my
pen for decades have criticised them because of this imperfection. I foresaw
that unless undesirable quality could be overcome, fluid extracts would not
maintain their position.

Fluid extracts are with few exceptions made by percolation according to one
general formula, the distinction being the menstruum selected. Still it must not
be inferred that carelessness or ignorance can be pardoned in one who attempts
to prepare fluid extracts. Upon the contrary, in my opinion, too much care and
too great experience have not as yet become a subject of criticism concerning
those engaged in this branch of pharmacy. The art of percolation, the nature of
drugs, the valuation of product, the study of changes, is, each of them, capable
of consuming a devoted life. And yet while the fluid extract at the best is imperfect, it is a useful remedy when fresh and conscientiously made, although
thoughtful, experienced pharmacists perceive fully the imperfections, to which
I will now briefly allude.

They are prone to precipitate; they are usually thick with inert matters, both
colored and colorless. They are of variable strength, owing both to variation in
the quality of crude drugs and the care of the manufacturer.

I have said that these preparations must be carefully made, and I shall not
hesitate to further express myself on this point. Physicians should not accept
that a novice in pharmacy can successfully make these remedies. This view will
be upheld by all manufacturers of pharmaceutical preparations and by all experienced pharmacists, and will be attacked only by persons destitute of practical
experience sufficient to give themselves a fair knowledge of the subject.

Fluid extracts are intended by the Pharmacopoeial committee to represent
practically one grain of drug to one minim of the finished preparation. The
present revision of that book makes it one gramme to one cubic centimeter. Still


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 41

this comes so close to the foregoing as to be unimportant when the variation of
the drug is concerned, not to speak of the difference in manipulation by different pharmacists.

I shall close the subject by saying that the following formule, one from
the United States Pharmacopaia, and the other from King’s Dispensatory, are
typical of the usual process for making fluid extracts, but that unless a person
has been well drilled in pharmacy it is worse than folly for him to attempt to
follow either of them:

‘*Fluid Extract of Podophyllum:—

Podophyllum, in No. 60 powder, one thousand grammes 1,000 Gm.
Alcohol,
Water, of each, a sufficient quantity

To make one thousand cubic centimeters 1,000 Ce.

Mix eight hundred (800) cubic centimeters of Alcohol with two hundred
(200) cubic centimeters of Water, and, having moistened the powder with three
hundred (300) cubic centimeters of the mixture, pack it firmly in a cylindrical
percolator; then add enough menstruum to saturate the powder and leave a
stratum above it. When the liquid begins to drop from the percolator, close the
lower orifice, and, having closely covered the percolator, macerate for fortyeight hours. Then allow the percolation to proceed, gradually adding menstruum, using the same proportions of Alcohol and Water as before, until the
Podophyllum is exhausted. Reserve the first eight hundred and fifty (850)
centimeters of the percolate. Distil off the Alcohol from the remainder by means
of a water-bath, and evaporate the residue to a soft extract; dissolve this in the
reserved portion, and add enough menstruum to make Fluid Extract measure
one thousand (1,000) cubic centimeters.’’—U. S. P.

“Fluid Extract of Polymnia:—

Synonyms—Fluid Extract of uvedalia; Fluid extract of bear’s foot.

Preparation—Take of the root of Polymnia Uvedalia, in moderately fine
powder, 16 troy ounces; Alcohol, a sufficient quantity. Moisten the powder with
6 fluid ounces of Alcohol. Cork tightly in a wide mouth bottle, and permit the
mixture to stand an hour in a warm situation. Then introduce it into a cylindrical percolator, three inches in diameter, previously prepared for percolation,
according to directions given on page 756, and press very firmly. Cover the
surface of the powder with a circular piece of filtering paper, held in position
with a few fragments of glass or marble, and add alcohol until the percolate
appears at the exit. Then cork the exit tightly, cover the percolator and place
in a warm situation.

After twenty-four hours, lcosen the cork and permit the percolate to pass as
fast as it will drop, without running in a stream, until four fluid ounces are
obtained. Again close the exit, macerate twenty-four hours, and in a manner
like unto the preceding draw four fluid ounces of percolate. Repeat the maceration, and in like manner draw a third portion of four fluid ounces. Reserve and
mix the three percolates; then continue the percolation until eight fluid ounces
are obtained. Evaporate this latter portion until reduced to the measure of two
fluid ounces, and mix with the reserved twelve fluid ounces. The surface of the
powder must be constantly covered with alcohol from the commencement and
until the end of the process of percolation.’’—King’s American Dispensatory.

Extracts (Solid Extracts)—When a fluid extract is evaporated until the
residue reaches a masslike consistence, a prime solid extract results. Such fluid
extracts, however, as contain glycerin cannot be reduced to this consistence. Solid
extracts, therefore, do not contain any therapeutic qualities in addition to those
possessed by the tincture, and as has been already said may be much injured
by heat and atmospheric influence during evaporation.

For some purposes, however, as in making pills, ointments and plasters,
where liquids cannot be employed, these preparations answer a good purpose,
although the physician should administer liquid plant remedies if he desires to
obtain the full effect of the drug. The bulk of each solid extract is composed of
inert extractive matters, such as gum, glucose, earthy salts, coloring matters,
chlorophyl and other bodies possessed of little if any medicinal value. This is
especially the case with aqueous extracts, and hydro-alecoholic extracts, some of
which are nearly valueless.

At the best, commercial solid extracts are less reliable than either tinctures
or fluid extracts, although when care and skill are employed in their preparation
active drugs may yield very energetic remedies. Among the most creditable and
definite solid extracts is to be found the official solid extract of physostigma,
formula for which is herein introduced:

“Extract of Physostigma:—

Physostigma, in No. 80 powder, one thousand grammes, 1,000 Gm.
Alcohol, a sufficient quantity.

Moisten the powder with four hundred (400) cubic centimeters of Alcohol
and pack it firmly in a cylindrical percolator; then add enough Alcohol to saturate the powder and leave a stratum above it. When the liquid begins to drop
from the percolator, close the lower orifice, and, having closely covered the percolator, macerate for forty-eight hours. Then allow the percolation to proceed,
gradually adding Alcohol, until three thousand (3,000) cubic centimeters of
tincture are obtained, or the Physostigma is exhausted. Reserve the first nine
hundred (900) cubic centimeters of the percolate, and evaporate the remainder.
at a temperature not exceeding 50 deg. C. (122 deg. F.) to one hundred (100)
cubic centimeters; mix this with the reserved portion, and evaporate at or below
ia aaa temperature, in a water-bath, to a pilular consistence.’’—

The Pharmacopeia and Dispensatories give special directions for making —
a large list of solid extracts, but these are only of general interest to physicians.

Solid extracts that are used in making pills, ointments and plasters seem
to hold their own in commerce, but for internal administration (excepting,
perhaps, with a few energetic drugs) they are fast being discarded.

Powdered Solid Extracts are as has been said, dried fluid extracts. They
are even less acceptable than mass extracts. They seem, as a rule, excepting
such as contain fixed therapeutical constituents, to possess little reliability. The
final act of drying an extract is exceptionally disastrous to the delicate extractives. Much harm to pharmacy and to medicine has been done, in my
opinion, by thoughtlessly believing that the drug values of tinctures and fluid
preparations of many drugs can be carried into a dry condition. Among the
most ereditable powdered solid extracts is that of opium when made by the
official process, which, like the method of making all good pharmaceutical preparations, cannot be followed by incompetent persons. This formula may be cited
as a specimen of this class as follows:

“*Extract of Opium:—

Powdered Opium, one hundred grammes 100 Gm.
Sugar of Milk, recently dried and in fine powder,
Water, each a sufficient quantity.

Triturate the Powdered Opium in a mortar thoroughly with one thousand
(1,000) cubic centimeters of water; repeat the trituration occasionally, in the
course of twelve hours; then filter through a rapidly-acting double filter, and
wash the filter and residue with water until the filtrate is nearly colorless. Concentrate the filtrate and washings in a tarred capsule, on a water bath, until

cold.

Determine the weight exactly; transfer twelve grammes of it to an Erlemeyer flask, a capacity of about one hundred (100) cubic centimeters, and determine in this portion the amount of morphine by the process of assay given
below, using the quantities of liquids there directed for four (4) grammes of
the dry extract. In another portion of five (5) grammes determine the amount
of water by drying it in a flat bottomed capsule, at 100 deg. C. (212 Deg. F.)
until it ceases to lose weight. From the results thus obtained ascertain, by
ealeulation, the amount of morphine and of water contained in the remainder
of the extract, and to this enough well-dried Sugar of Milk to bring the quantity
of Morphine in the final dry extract to eighteen (18) per cent., then evaporate
the whole to dryness, reduce it to powder, and transfer it to small, well-stoppered vials.’’—U. S. P.

Medicated Wines are solutions of medicinal substances in which wine is
the menstruum. In a few cases, as with Bitter Wine of Iron, both organic and
inorganic substances are employed. In others, as with Wine of Ferric Citrate,
an inorganic compound is dissolved in white wine. Others, as Wine of Ipecac,
are made of a single plant, while others still, as Wine of Opium, are made of
mixtures of plant products. The medicated wines are nearly obsolete, being at
best, seldom used in eclecticism.

Vinegars—These not very uniform preparations are similar to tinctures,
excepting that in making them either diluted acetic acid or vinegar is used as
a menstruum instead of alcohol. The early eclectic physicians considered several medicinal vinegars with some degree of favor, for example, Vinegar of
Lobelia, Vinegar of Sanguinaria, etc., and, even to this day, King’s Expectorant,
a compound Vinegar, is valued by many eclectics,

In carrying the subject to unofficial plant products, I shall conclude by a
few general remarks that must necessarily be brief. From time to time manufacturing pharmacists and apothecaries have introduced special new preparations, either of single drugs or of mixtures of drugs. Out of these grew many
compounds, now found in the foregoing classes; because of a demand arising with
physicians, their recognition became necessary. In the early days of eclecticism
a class of preparations was evolved concerning which I must say a word. These,
known as the ‘‘eclectic resinoids or concentrations,’’ as a rule were made by
private processes.

Resinoids and Concentrations—At that early day, the natures of drugs
were very poorly understood. Indeed, they are not as yet too fully comprehended. American pharmacy was an untrodden field, and it is not to be wondered that blunders and errors concerning some products crept into existence.
Consequently, while many of the ‘‘resinoids’’ proved to be useful remedies,
others were valueless. Gradually the enthusiastic parties concerned in ‘‘resinoids’’ were led to appreciate the fact that it was impossible to carry the
full, or even the partial, therapeutic values of most plants into a dry condition, and at last the majority of the class of resinoids was abandoned by its
advocates. Still the labor of these most zealous men was not altogether lost,
for a few of the so-called resinoids stand yet as creditable remedies and a
few as definite chemicals such as these are used the world over by all classes
of physicians.

But the bright anticipations of the earnest men concerned in the evolution
of these preparations were shattered by ill advised commercialism, and as a
result much that had been hastily accepted concerning their qualities had to be
relinquished. This fact is patent to whoever will take the pains to read the
remarks of Prof. King on this subject in the American Dispensatory. The fact
is, the ‘‘resinoids’’ became typical of the results of deplorable pharmaceutical

processes. They were products that had no rational home. Neither alkaloids,
extracts, nor ultimates, they found themselves discredited pharmaceutical incongruities.

For a long period after these exasperating experiences, eclectic physicians
contented themselves with the classes of preparations such as syrups, tinctures,
fluid extracts, etc., many of the members being of eclectic origin. But about
this date all physicians were prone to prescribe mixtures—compound syrups,
compound powders, compound tinctures, compound extracts, etc., and, indeed,
the tendency of eclecticism was towards medication by means of complex miztures.

Then came Prof. John M. Scudder, who united with several eclectic physicians and rebelled against polypharmacy medication. They asserted that physicians should study the action of single drugs, and if mixtures were to be prescribed, should, when possible, make the mixtures when prescribing for the
patient. These authorities viewed commercial fluid extracts with disfavor. In
their opinion they were open to serious objections. They were also for rational
reasons strongly averse to such blanket pharmaceutical preparations as syrups
and elixirs; but as the course of these men in this direction is a matter of history,
comments in detail are unnecessary.

This innovation, the use of selected remedies for direct medication, was
strongly opposed at first by many talented physicians who disliked to change
their methods. But gradually it was seen that the opponents to dosage by complex mixtures and polypharmacy (shotgun medication) aimed to further a
pleasant and advanced therapy. Conspicuous dissenters from the principles
enunciated by these advocates of a more direct practice of medicine, came gradually to be stanch supporters of the principles advocated. That they were correct in their views is shown by the trend of medical science today.

Specific Medicines—In the beginning of this crusade against mixtures and
compounds, these classes of shotgun preparations were aggressively attacked,
no words being spared in doing so. It was demanded that physicians who proposed to practice rational or specific methods should use simple representatives
of plants that had been gathered in their prime and when in their best condition worked by careful methods. Dr. Scudder gave superficial formule in the
first edition of his work, Specific Medication, for office manipulation of fresh
drugs, but in this he made a serious mistake, for he was not a pharmacist and
his pharmaceutical methods were not productive of the products he desired.
Consequently this defect in his book tended to discourage those who attempted
to follow the formule he gave, which, however, he stated were intended only
for country physicians who could not conveniently purchase the: more concentrated remedies but who could procure fresh drugs from the fields and woods.
The eclectic medicines known as Specific Medicines were thus introduced as a
line of remedies, each being labeled true to drug name, each depending for its
position on legitimate pharmaccutical skill and care, and, as now prepared,
all of them have been developed by years of study and the expenditure of
much money in scientific experimentation.

Unquestionably the high standing they now occupy results from these many
years of close application, not a little of which is comprised in the knowledge
gained by the study of crude materials, the proper season for collecting drugs,
and the conditions best fitted for their manipulation.

The vegetable specific medicines may be defined as preparations of plants,
each labeled under the full name of the drug yielding it. Each drug is worked
in accordance with the process that experience has demonstrated is applicable
to the abstraction, purification and retention of the medicinal constituents of
that particular drug. The aim has been to exclude coloring matters as much
as possible and inert extractive substances also from these preparations, conse-

quently, with a few exceptions, they are light in color and yet they are very
characteristic of the drug. They differ from class fluids, such as tinctures and
fluid extracts, in that they are not prepared by rule of thumb methods as concerns menstruum and process. With them, the word quality is preferred to
strength. The energetic (strength) part of a drug may-dominate a preparation to the destruction of quality.

In some cases Prof. Scudder used special chemical compounds little known
then in medicine, and included them in his first list of specific remedies.

Homeopathic Mother Tinctures—These alcoholic preparations are admirable remedies in many respects, but lack the concentration to which eclectic
physicians employing specific medicines are accustomed. They may not always
be exactly uniform, different manufacturers and authorities, perhaps, varying
their methods somewhat, and yet resultant differences are probably not sufficient
to disturb dilutions made of them. The exceeding care directed by homeopathic
pharmacopoeias concerning the selection and gathering of crude material cannot but excite admiration, and although as a rule the mother tinctures represent
much less than the drug used in making them (dry drug taken as a standard),
still, aside from their deficient strength, they are excellent preparations. Eclectie physicians desirous of studying the materia medica of the homeopathic profession more explicitly will find an excellent treatise in the ‘‘Pharmacopoeia of
the American Institute of Homeopathy.’’

Briefly stated, each homeopathic mother tincture made of a plant represents
nearly one-tenth the plant (‘‘drug strength 1-10’’), and is so recognized by
those making and using them. But, as has been said, owing to the care in collecting the drug, the fact that in many cases the plant is not dried, and the
explicit details of pharmaceutical manipulation, the resultant preparations are
very clean and useful remedies. As a rule, they are light in color.

Remedies for External Use—Passing now from plant preparations to other
classes of pharmaceutical preparations, brief mention should be made of a series
of preparations designed as external remedies. These begin with liniments which
are liquids, and pass by successive steps of gradation to plasters which are so
hard as to be brittle when cold. The first to be considered, therefore, is the class
known as the

Liniments—These are liquid at ordinary temperature, are usually oily
mixtures, and often contain energetic drugs designed to be used by inunction.
A number of formulae for liniments are given in the Pharmacopoeia, of which
that for Ammonia or Volatile Liniment is a familiar specimen. In some cases,
however, no oil is used, a typical example being Belladonna Liniment. In this
connection I will say that the late Prof. John King used liniments extensively
that were free from oils, the liquid employed as the medicine carrier being saturated solution of ammonium chloride. He claimed that better effects could be
obtained by associating such substances as spirit of camphor, tincture of opium
and aconite with this liquid as a carrier than by means of any fat or oil, to all
of which he objected on account of their uncleanliness.

Ointments—These preparations are made of fats, such as lard and tallow,
medicated, and are employed in a manner similar to liniments. They are, as a
rule, of a stiff consistence in cold weather, but should melt at the temperature
of the body. Hence, like liniments, they can be used to apply drugs by inuncae An excellent base is the official Simple Ointment (Ointment) made as

‘ollows:

“Ointment:—
Lard, eight hundred grammes, 800 Gm.
Yellow Wax, two hundred grammes 200 Gm.

To make one thousand grammes 1,000 Gm.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 46

PHARMACY AND PHARMACOGNOSY 61

Melt the Yellow Wax, and gradually add it to the Lard; then stir the mixture constantly until it is cool.’’—U. S. P.

As an example of a medicated ointment made by means of simple ointment, the Ointment of Carbolic Acid may be taken as an example:

“Ointment of Carbolic Acid:—

Carbolie Acid, five grammes 5 Gm.

Ointment, ninety-five grammes 95 Gm.
To make one hundred grammes: 100 Gm.
Mix them thoroughly.’’

—U. S. P.

By employing Simple Ointment as a base, physicians can in like manner
use any desired medicine therewith. In some cases aqueous liquids or aqueous
extracts are to be incorporated with fats. This is often difficult; but if the physician will prescribe equal parts of hydrous wool fat and simple ointment, large
amounts of water or watery liquid will be taken up.

Glycerole of Starch has an ointment consistence and is not greasy. It can
be used as an excipient to carry medicines by inunction and is not subject to the
uncleanliness of greasy bodies.

Cerates—Are made of fats and wax and are of such consistence that, at the
temperature of the body, they remain plastic and do not melt. Thus they are
designed to hold a remedy in contact with the skin, by excluding the air. As
an example the official Simple Cerate (Cerate) may be cited as follows:—

“Cerate:—.

White Wax, three hundred grammes, 300 Gm.
Lard, seven hundred grammes, 700 Gm.
To make one thousand grammes, 1,000 Gm.

u ett them together, and stir the mixture constantly until it is cool.’’—
Typical of familiar cerates of the olden time is the well known Cantharides
Cerate or blistering cerate, a barbarous remedy often used inhumanly and without judgment. Happily, it is fast becoming obsolete, in the evolution that is
rapidly retiring the abusive methods and medicines of medieval days.

Plasters—These preparations are so stiff, that at the temperature of the
body they are elastic and adhesive, but not soft. Hence when heated and spread
on sheepskin or on muslin, and then applied to the skin, they adhere, maintaining their position. By this means remedies incorporated into a plaster may be
held firmly in contact with the skin. The usual plaster base is known as Lead
Plaster and is made according to the pharmacopoeia as follows:

“Lead Plaster (Diachylon Plaster):—

Lead Oxide, three thousand two hundred grammes, 3,200 Gm.
Olive Oil, siz thousand grammes, 6,000 Gm.
Water, a sufficient quantity.

Mix the lead oxide, previously passed through a No. 80 sieve, intimately
with about one-half of the Olive Oil, by trituration, and add the mixture to the
remainder of the Oil contained in a bright copper boiler of a capacity equal to
at least four times the bulk of the ingredients. Then add one thousand (1,000)
cubic centimeters of boiling Water, and boil the whole together, over a fire,
constantly stirring with a wooden spatula, until a small portion when dropped
into cold water is found to be pliable and tenacious. From time to time add a
little water to replace that lost by evaporation. When the contents of the boiler
have acquired a whitish color and are perfectly homogeneous, transfer them to

a vessel containing warm water, and as soon as the mass has sufficiently cooled,
knead it well with the water so as to remove the glycerin, renewing the water
from time to time, as long as it may be necessary. Finally divide the mass into
rolls of suitable size.

A yellowish-white, pliable and tenacious, but not greasy mass gradually
acquiring a brownish tint on the outside.

On treating 5 Gm. of Lead Plaster with 25 Ce. of benzol, a somewhat viscid
and slightly turbid solution will result, which will separate into a clear and
gelatinous layer after some time, but which should not deposit any sediment
(absence of uncombined lead oxide).’’—U. S. P.

Liquors or Solutions—These compounds are aqueous solutions of chemical
substances. They are designed both for internal and external use and among
them are to be found many energetic remedies. Thus, Fowler’s Solution of Arsenic and Donovan’s Solution of Iodide of Arsenic and of Iodide of Mercury are
samples of active remedies designed for internal use, while Solution of Subacetate of Lead is for use externally. Among the official solutions is to be found
lime water (Liquor Calcis), Spirit of Mindererus (Liquor Ammonii Acetatis)
and many other similar specimens of old-time pharmaceutical preparations, few
of which, however, are employed by eclectic physicians.

Spiritus or Spirits—This class of preparations embraces the alcoholic solutions of such substances as oils, camphor, glonoin, ete. Among them are to be
found Sweet Spirit of Nitre, Hoffman’s Anodyne (Compound Spirit of Ether),
Spirit of Ammonia (not ammonia water), Whisky, Brandy, Bay Rum, and
similar alcoholic liquids. This class is quite voluminous and many of its members are extensively employed in medicine.

Medicated Waters—Under the term aquae are to be found such substances
as ammonia water, camphor water, chlorine water, distilled water, ete. The
medicated waters embrace the popular aqueous solutions of oils and in these
cases are made by first triturating the oil with calcium phosphate to effect its
distribution over much surface, after which the mixture is abstracted with
water. The following formula from the U. S. Pharmacopoeia is typical of this
class:

“Peppermint Water:—

Oil of Peppermint, two cubic centimeters..... 0.00. c cece cece nee e anes
Precipitated Calcium Phosphate, four grammes

Distilled Water, a sufficient quantity

To make one thousand cubic centimeters..........eccceeeeeenes 1,000 Ce.

Triturate the Oil of Peppermint with the Precipiated Calcium Phosphate;
add the Distilled Water, gradually, under constant trituration, and filter.’’—
U.S. P.:

Among the medicated waters may also be found rose water and orange
flower water, both of which are made by distillation of fresh flowers.

Medicated Wines—Among the earliest pharmaceutical preparations were
to be found solutions of drugs in wine. The alcohol therein tended both to help
exhaust plants and to preserve the product from putrefaction. Thus wine of
ipecac is typical of wines made from a vegetable remedy. But all medicated
wines are not made of vegetable drugs; for example, wine of antimony is a solution.of tartar emetic in wine. Among the wines are to be found the common
beverages, white wine made by fermenting the juice of fresh grapes freed from
seeds, stems and skins; and red wine made of colored grapes, including their
skins, These are used in preparing the medicated wines. Eclectic physicians
use medicated wines very sparingly, with the exception of the old eclectic wine
bitters, which is still a favorite with many.

Vinegars—This class of liquids contains acetic acid or vinegar. They were
once used freely, but have fallen largely into disuse. The vinegars (aceta) are
peculiarly adapted to alkaloidal drugs, and in early eclectic pharmacy such
substances as vinegar of lobelia and vinegar of sanguinaria were popular. In
the regular school of medicine vinegar of opium or black drop was once a favorite. The chief vinegar in use at present is vinegar of squill, which is employed
in making syrup of squill. In this class may also be placed the acetous emetic
compound of early eclecticism.

Emulsions are mechanical mixtures of oils and water, the admixture being
facilitated by the influence of some body capable of affiliating them without
chemically altering the oil. Yolk of egg, powdered acacia or powdered tragaeanth are usually employed for this purpose. The Pharmacopeia recognizes
emulsions made of gum resins, such as ammonia and asafetida in which no
foreign emulsifier is necessary. At present manufacturers have supplied emulsions that are made by means of machinery and are very thoroughly emulsified.

Elixirs—Originally the term elixir in pharmacy was applied to compound
tinctures, and they were destitute of sugar. Thus Compound Tincture of Senna
(Elixir Salutis) is an example of an original elixir. As a rule elixirs were
nasty mixtures and harsh remedies, of which Compound Tincture of Aloes is a
good specimen.

But about half a century ago the compound, ‘‘Simms’ Cordial Elixir of
Calisaya,’’ a sweetened and flavored cordial, was introduced. It wag followed
by other palatable cordials and soon the term ‘‘elixir’’ was used in America in
direct opposition to the original meaning. A great list of sweet alcoholic compounds followed, as trade elixirs, and a few are employed yet, but as a rule the
elixir is now neglected. Physicians have learned that it is-tiot advisable to give
a tablespoonful of flavored syrup and a teaspoonful of alcohol in order to get a
trifling amount of medicine.

Triturations—These mixtures are made of drugs and milk sugar, and are
great favorites with homeopathic physicians. According to their methods two
systems of trituration are employed, one in which one part of the drug is to be
triturated with nine parts of milk sugar, the other in which one part of the dru
is to be triturated with ninety-nine parts of milk sugar. The first sivouvd fs
known as the decimal system, the second as the centesimr! system. For explicit
details concerning these and other similar preparation the reader is referred
te the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia. The U. S. Pharmacope@ia directs as folows:

“Triturations:—
Unless otherwise directed, Triturations are to be prepared by the following formula:
“Take of
The Substance, ten grammes.....cccccc ccc eccccreceeceeeeeeeeeeees 10 Gm.
Sugar of Milk, in moderately fine powder, ninety grammes............ 90 Gm.
To make one hundred grammes, 100 Gm.

‘‘Weigh the substance and the sugar of milk separately; then place the substance, previously reduced, if necessary, to a moderately fine powder, in a mortar; add about an equal measure of sugar of milk, mix well by means of spatula,
and triturate them thoroughly together. Then add fresh portions of the sugar
of milk, from time to time, until the whole is added, and continue the trituration until the substance is intimately mixed with the sugar of milk and reduced
to a fine powder.’’—U. S. P.

In eclectic medicine, trituration of resin of podophyllum, both 1 in 10 and
1 in 100, and trituration of carbo vegetabilis, are much prized.

Confections are mixtures of syrup, honey, sugar and drugs. They have
a pasty consistence, often being quite stiff. Confections are relics of medieval
pharmacy, having once been very popular as well as numerous. At present
but two representatives are to be found in the U. S. P., one being Confection
of Rose, the other Confection of Senna. Confections are not used at’ all in
eclectic medicine.

Troches are related to confections, in that they are sugar compounds.
They are, in fact, medicated sugar candy lozenges, many formulas for them
being found in the pages of the U. S. Pharmacopoeia. But they have only a
limited use in eclectic practice, and, indeed, this may also apply to the majority
of physicians in other sections of the profession. Sugar Coated Pills should
be classified with troches. They came into use about fifty years ago, the first
sugar coated pills I knew being large oval pellets imported from France under
the term dragees.

Sugar Coated Pills are excellent forms in which to administer many organic drugs, and also solid extracts, resins, etc. Of late years they have been
somewhat neglected by physicians, but, in my opinion, such neglect, in many
cases, is without due consideration of the relative claims of the respective
remedies. Many vegetable substances that can be reduced to a plastic condition without serious injury, cannot be dried completely without rendering
them valueless, or nearly so. These plastic substances can, however, be made
into sugar coated pills, but in order to make tablets of any drug it must be
dry as powder. Sugar coated pills are made by the simple process of first
cutting out the pill mass, rolling it and then coating the pills with a sugar
in a candy machine such as confectioners use to coat nuts. The risk that users
of sugar coated pills have to guard against is the effect of the heat that is
spphied to the pill if it be reduced to perfect dryness after being cut and before it is coated.

Gelatine Coated Pills—These, in my opinion, are superior to any and all
forms of candy or similar medicines. They have the advantage of being
easily me 7~ nvt of very moist pill masses, and of being easily coated when still
soft anu.noist, a feat that is impossible to accomplish with some drugs in the
heated sugar coating machine. The gelatine excludes the air, preserves the contents of the pill, and is tasteless and harmless.

Tablets—These are related to the troches in that they are divided dises,
but they are very different from troches in that no troche is illogical in its
composition, while many tablets are masqueradecrs. Tablets are cheap machine stamped out discs, and became popular very rapidly because of thcir
neat appearance and convenient form. But the tablet craze was soon carried
to extremes, much (as I believe) to the discredit of a line of preparations,
that, had they been handled conservatively, would have been exceptionally
useful remedies. Many tablets are fine remedies; others are unworthy of confidence. The fact is though, either in over-zeal or from listening to indiscreet
advisers, makers of tablets have been very injudicious, and have injured their
interest in selecting tablet compounds that on their face are shown to be at
once destroyed or much injured in the drying process. It seems as if the old
eclectic resinoid blunder is being repeated by tablet enthusiasts. It therefore
behooves physicians to closely scrutinize the natures of the substances that appear under the tablet label. In my opinion certain physicians have been very
thoughtless when they have displaced gelatine coated pills by means of tablets; but in this connection it is evident that thoughtful pharmacists and physicians are now looking seriously at the tablet subject, and it is probable that
discriminative study concerning the possibilities of remedies will ultimately
exclude impractical formule. No tablet can be made to represent evanescent
plant preparations or those in which alcohol is necessary as a preservative.

Suppositories—These are made of a concrete fat into which various remedial agents are incorporated. They are designed for orificial medication, and
are of various sizes and shapes. Oil of Theobroma (butter of cacao) is the
usual fatty base, although about 10 per cent. of Japan Wax may be added to
advantage in very warm weather. Several descriptions of suppository moulds
are sold by druggists’ supply houses. According to the U. S. Pharmacopoeia,
suppositories should conform to the following conditions:

“‘Unless otherwise specified, Suppositories should have the following
weights and shapes, corresponding to their several uses:

niet Suppositories should be cone shaped, and of a weight of about
one e.

Urethral Suppositories should be pencil shaped, and of a weight of about
one (1) gramme.

Vaginal Suppositories should be globular, and of a weight of about three
(8) grammes.’’—U. S. P.

In prescribing Suppositories it should be expected that the physician will
designate the medicinal ingredients and their proportion, as well as designate the size of the suppository, and will leave the making of the suppository
mass to the pharmacist who prepares them.

Sedatives Commonly Used in the Control of Fevers—Antipyretics.

GELSEMIUM. VERATRUM. RHUS TOXICODENDRON.
ACONITE, BRYONIA. SYNTHETIC DEPRESSANTS.

Note—During the entire history of the evolution of the present method
of direct prescribing, the search of every investigator has been after a single
remedy which may be applied to each of the common conditions which are
found among both premonitory symptoms, and among those subsequently
developing. The investigator, in the course of his work, develops an inate
ability to quickly determine which of these indications are basic, and which
are secondary. He endeavors at once from these, to determine what the disease is, and what is its cause.

Failing in this in the first examination, he does not under any circumstances wait until the entire condition can be determined without doubt, and
the disease named, before he prescribes, but he at once prescribes for that
most conspicuous condition, or for two or even more, if they seem to be sufiiciently plain.

By this course, he is convinced that conditions are at once contralled
which would have led to very important, serious, or, perhaps, fatal disorders.
Prescribing for the total disease by name has led many a physician into
error. It is important that he know what the group of symptoms is called,
as soon as possible, but he must never lose sight of the specific indications
present in that individual which require immediate attention.

With those of us who are trained in this method of practice, the first
condition in acute disorders to which our attention is directed is the circulation. We endeavor to keep this always as near as possible to the normal
point. The severity of any acute disease we are convinced, is in proportion to the variation of these conditions from a normal standard. In proportion then as we are able to bring the temperature to, and keep it near to
the normal, are we able to restrain disease processes, or to remove the
results of these processes in which the circulation and temperature are influenced.

Excessive action of any character in any of the body processes must be
restrained. A violent impression will produce a correspondingly violent reaction. The persistent, steady effects of small, frequently repeated doses of
medicine, with no reaction, are in every way superior to the violent effects
of large doses. The violence of the disease is to be fully considered, however, and the dose prescribed accordingly.

The first four of the above named remedies are Motor Depressants, and
are of first importance in the treatment of fevers. They may well be called
Special Sedatives.

12. MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

The progress of fever, its unarrested violence, is often the cause of localized inflammation—not always the result of it. Suppressed secretion is the
cause of the fever in many eases, and the fever in time determines which is
the susceptible organ, for there inflammation becomes seated.

Again, the severity of any acute inflammatory disorder depends upon
the severity of the fever, and the control the physician is able to exercise
over the fever determines the amount of control he exercises over the processes of the inflammation. No fever, however mild, notwithstanding frequent arguments to the contrary, should come to the knowledge of the physician, especially in children, without its being at once antagonized by the
properly indicated remedy.

Masius and Stockweiss, Semmola and others, confidently assert that fever
is not an essential process to natural elimination and must be restrained.

In continued fevers the reaction which will follow the powerful depressing effects of large doses of active coal tar antipyretics is more injurious
than the fever processes, if such reaction occurs. If not, the depression is
apt to be fatal.

In continued fevers the steady impression induced by small but frequent doses of those agents which restrain heart action and heat production by their tonic effect upon the nerve centers and vital processes, is in
every way superior to the large doses of the commoner synthetic antipyretics.
The depressing action of the latter, without compensation, is entirely too
great.

GELSEMIUM, GELSEMIUM SEMPERVIRENS.

Synonym—Yellow jasmine.

ConstITUENTS—Gelsemine, Gelsemic Acid, Gelseminine, Volatile Oil, Gum,
Starch, Resin.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Gelsemii Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Gelsemium.
Dose, from one-half to ten minims.

Tinctura Gelsemii, Tincture of Gelsimium. Macerate and percolate with
dilute alcohol. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Specific Medicine Gelsemium. Dose, from one-third to ten minims, prescribed, ten minims to five drachms in four ounces of water. Teaspoonful
every half hour to two hours.

Administration—Gelsemium is:a prompt remedy if given in sufficiently
active dosage. The excellent results obtained by the older physicians were
obtained from full doses. Children are more susceptible to its action than
adults, and with them the smaller dosage is applicable. In spasms the maximum dose is needed. If toxie effects are obtained, they can be readily observed and antagonized with no harm to the patient.

Gelsemium is quickly eliminated from the system, largely through the
kidneys, consequently the effects of single doses are quickly dissipated, and
medicinal doses must thus be given frequently, especially in childhood, to
insure good results. Single full doses should be given only to adults.

The remedy can be given in single doses of from fifteen to twenty minims,
but any dose of three drops or more must be watched for physiological effects,
and diminished when these appear.

Physiological Action—Usually upon the administration of an overdose
of this agent there is at first some excitement, followed by depression of the
nervons system, with dizziness, amblyopia, double vision, dilated pupils, exophthalmos, complete prostration, with drooping of the upper eyelids from
paralysis of the levator palpebre superioris and inability to keep the jaw

closed. The temperature is reduced, the force and frequency of the pulse
is lowered, with dyspnow, the breathing being accomplished with much effort,
and death usually results from paralysis of the respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm. The influence appears to be exercised upon the base of
the brain, on the brain, on the splanchnic nerves and on the spinal cord. It
inhibits the nerve force of all the visceral organs and relaxes the sphincters.
Convulsions are one of the results of poisonous doses in animals. In man,
while there is loss of sensation gnd motion, the patient is conscious of what
is going on around him, unless the symptoms are prolonged, when deficient
oxygenation of the blood, with accumulation of carbonic acid, will produce
coma.

In experiments made upon pigeons the effects are very similar to those
resulting from destruction of a portion of the cerebellum. There are irregular
backward movements, tremblings, flutterings of the wings, preceding complete paralysis.

Gelsemium in lethal doses paralyzes the nerves, both sensory and motor.
The motor nerves are first influenced, the paralysis of sensation more slowly
following. The writer observed a case of poisoning where the patient had
taken sixty minims of the fluid extract within forty-five minutes. A sensation
of general oppression occurred rather suddenly. The patient rose to her
feet, noticed that vision had failed almost completely, walked two or three
steps, then fell in a mass upon the floor in a state of complete muscular relaxation. There was no alarm or fear, a rather tranquil feeling mentally, and
in this case there was no great difficulty of breathing, although we have
observed dyspnea from single doses of two or three minims of the fluid extract. The recovery of this patient was rapid, although muscular weakness
was present for several days.

The primary influence of gelsemium—that which probably always underlies its remedial influence upon any condition—should be borne steadily
in mind in its administration. Its direct action is upon the central nervous
system. It diminishes the blood supply of the brain and spinal cord by lessening nerve power, inhibiting the nerve control, slowing, retarding or staying
the functional action of the nerve centers over the nerves themselves, influencing them steadily in the line of their physiological activities. It thus
subdues all forms of nerve excitation of whatever character, or wherever
located. It inhibits excessive nerve action. Nerve irritation, whether direct
or reflex, comes uniformly under its influence.

There must be, then, increased nerve tension, with its consequent irritation, and usually, local hyperemia or increased and undue blood supply in
sthenic conditions. It is not the remedy when as asthenia prevails.

It may be well to introduce a caution which is most important, if good
results be secured from the action of this remedy. Gelsemium, more than perhaps any other of our agents, suffers from the fact that the market may be supplied by worthless preparations of the remedy. Any fluid extract or tincture
made from the dried drug does not contain the full virtues of the plant, and if
the drug has been long gathered will be almost inert. The green root should
be gathered in the early spring, and its medicinal virtues should be immediately
extracted. The green root fluid extracts, normal tinctures, and the specific
medicine gelsemium represents the fullest possible virtues of the drug. Furthermore, fluid preparations alone, of gelsemium, are prescribed by our physicians,
as clinical experience has conclusively demonstrated to us that the alkaloid gelsemin does not contain the full virtues of the drug.

Specific Symptomatology—The characteristic syndrome which demands
the administration of gelsemium is found in acute determination of blood
to the brain— acute cerebral hyperemia—manifested by a bright flush upon


<!-- chunk -->

the face, bright eyes with contracted pupils, with a busy restlessness and
excitability. With these there is a high degree of nerve tension and consequent irritation, with increased heat of the head and face. There is present
in acute cases, elevated temperature, hot skin, usually dry, a sharp and
quick pulse, but not always hard. Given in sufficient doses it slows the
heart’s action, reduces the temperature and quiets the respiration, speedily
producing a restful sense of tranquility.

Increased arterial and nervous tension gand local or general irritation
present in many cases of local inflammation, especially of the kidneys, are
specifically met by this agent.

Therapy—In the acute fevers of childhood, some evidences of nerve irritation are seldom absent. Here the agent exercises its happiest influence.
Muscular twitchings with the above specific symptoms demand this remedy.
If spasms supervene, the dose is increased in size and frequency until they
are controlled. Often no other agent need be given.

The direct contra-indication is congestion, either of the nerve centers
alone, or of any organ. The phenomena of dullness, hebetude, obstructed circulation, whether local or general, with normal or lowering temperature, with
increasing weakness—asthenia—must be treated with the antitheses of gelsemium.:

In acute inflammation of whatever organ or part, there is likely to be
a time during its early course when gelsemium is the positively indicated
remedy. Its administration should cease when its indications are no longer
apparent.

In acute inflammations, especially those of childhood, or in persistent
fevers, where reflex irritation threatens to induce convulsions, other fever
remedies should usually be suspended for this until all irritation has
abated, or until its beneficial action is no longer conspicuously apparent.
If its physiological effects appear at any time during prolonged or protracted fever or inflammation, it should be suspended temporarily, or
permanently, within the judgment of the prescriber, as its full physiological
influence persisted in may impair nerve tonicity, and general tonicity of the
muscular system, or of the heart, to such a degree as to retard recovery, or
at least to prolong convalescence.

Fevers of nearly all kinds in adults, in the early and sthenic stage, are
influenced by gelsemium, because the above conditions to some degree may be
a part of the pathology of increased temperature.

The late Mr. Adolphus claimed that gelsemium exercised its first influence upon the heat centers in the cord and medulla. He always gave gelsemium for its influence here, in cerebro-spinal meningitis. Its indications
were the bright eyes, contracted pupils, the patient inclined to crowd the
back of the head in the pillow. His results were highly pleasing. Recent
reports in the treatment of cerebro-spinal meningitis in children are proving
that gelsemium given in conjunction with echinacea is proving to be the
very best treatment. The results from a large number of observers is very
convincing. Where the opisthotonos is extreme, they give both this and
lobelia, in some cases, hypodermically. The relaxation is definitely induced
by this method, and the spasms controlled. The use of these remedies in
this disease is very rational.

In acute cerebral, spinal, cerebro-spinal, or meningeal inflammations, its
symptomatology is usually strongly marked at first. If in adults, it may be
given at first in pronounced doses, lessened as the symptoms abate or as its
physiological action appears. In later stages of these disorders the dosage
should be much smaller, or some remedy more directly indicated should be
substituted. It should not usually be continued beyond the sthenic stage.

SEDATIVES USED IN THE CONTROL OF FEVERS 15

There are some forms of nervous wakefulness in which no better soporific
can be given than this agent. Begun early in the evening, a few full doses
will produce tranquillity and restful repose. If there be busy excitability
and extreme restlessness, its influence will be greatly enhanced by combination with hyoscyamus. Nervous headache, which drives away sleep, can
often be removed and sleep satisfactorily induced with this remedy. The
nervous system is in part restored during sleep so induced, and the patient
is rested.

In nervous excitation of women consequent upon acute peritonitis, ovaritis, salpingitis, metritis, puerperal fever, or mastitis, this agent has no peer.
It is especially commended in the early stages, and if hysterical phenomena
develop. Given in the early stages in pronounced, but carefully watched
dosage, it will occasionally abort the entire condition, especially if the cause
has been removed by proper methods. Extreme full doses are sometimes
admissible at first.

In puerperal convulsions this agent has a conspicuous place. If given
in accord with its exact symptomatology, in sufficiently large, often heroic
doses, but it’ must be exactly given. The symptomatology of veratrum is
more often present than that of this agent in eclampsia or the two may be
combined.

In intestinal inflammation it has not seemed to me to be often indicated
for the actual fever, and yet the reflex nerve phenomena, especially of children, often quickly demand it. It controls nervous or spasmodic pain in
these conditions, and I have found it of great service in appendicitis. It
seems to retard the inflammatory processes. It is of great advantage in the
tenesmus of dysentery, sometimes allaying this troublesome symptom in a
single full dose. Usually several frequent, pronounced doses are demanded.

In inflammation within the chest I have not used the agent as often as
bryonia and aconite. Others speak highly of it, and there are conditions
when the demands for them are too plain to be ignored. Certain forms of
asthma are relieved by it quite promptly. Others have had good results from
its influence in whooping cough and in laryngismus stridulus. It controls
certain forms of spasmodic cough and cough from reflex irritation.

Dr. Bugg, of Georgia, reported a case of hiccough which developed with
a severe bronchial cough from a cold. It had continued without cessation for
forty-eight hours until the patient was in a condition of exhaustion. The
doctor gave him—a previously strong negro—fifteen drops of gelsemium, because his eyes were ‘‘very bright and the pupils contracted to pin heads.’’
This medicine was repeated until the spasm was relieved.

In acute cold, the whole system is influenced by it, the coryza being
marked and all the usual symptoms pronounced. Gelsemium given in two or
three drop doses, every half hour for a few doses, will often give relief most
promptly and satisfactorily. In epidemic influenza it has been generally used
with signal results in nearly all cases.

In acute nephritis it is certainly a sovereign remedy. It at first meets
a wide range of the symptoms in a pronounced manner. It reduces the arterial
tension, often at orfce, and consequently the quantity of albumin. It exercises a permanent, soothing influence upon nerves of the entire urinary apparatus in a most satisfactory manner. The quantity of urine is increased, the general nervous phenomena are delayed, the fever abates, and any pain or spasms
are controlled. My practice has been to give macrotys with the gelsemium
in acute nephritis from cold, but I am positive the beneficial influence could
not be obtained without gelsemium.

In post diphtheritic or post scarlatinal nephritis it controls any undue
irritation, but belladonna acts upon the actual condition more satisfactorily

76 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

than gelsemium. In post puerperal nephritis, I should certainly fail of a
cure without this agent. In three very bad cases I gave gelsemium in full,
large doses with the best results. It anticipates the uremic symptoms, preserves tranquility of the nervous system, and wards off the otherwise almost
inevitable convulsions. It is of especial service in the spasmodic retention
of urine of hysterical women, or in acute urinary irritation.

Spasmodic pain in the urinary organs has no more reliable antidote
than gelsemium. Spasmodic pain in the bladder, or in the cystic sphincter,
is controlled quickly, and acute cystitis should be treated with gelsemium
from the first. The soothing influence of the agent upon the entire nerve distribution of these organs is soon evident. In spasmodic urethral stricture, where
pain is excruciating and nothing but a catheter will apparently do any good,
gelsemium in full doses is often all sufficient. I have had two marked cases
where the catheter could not be passed, in one case, even under chloroform,
where full repeated doses of gelsemium relieved the irritation and retention within two hours. I give from two to five drops of the Specific Medicine every twenty or thirty minutes, even if mild physiological symptoms
appear. In the tenesmus of chronic catarrhal cystitis, it is excellent.

In Gonorrhoea, in the acute stages, it is a very prompt remedy, especially
if used in conjunction with irrigation of the urethra. This remedy alone
will often produce much relief in twenty-four hours. Where there is much
excitement with chordee no remedy is more prompt.

Spasmodic types of ovarian neuralgia and neuralgic dysmenorrhea are
controlled with gelsemium. It relieves uterine colic and exercises a satisfactory influence in many cases as an emmenagogue, where nervous excitability is present.

In vomiting of pregnancy, Dr. Henderson has given ten drops of
gelsemium hypodermically in extreme cases, controlling the vomiting when the
physiological influence appeared. Caution is necessary, especially in asthenic
cases. >
In confinement it dilates a rigid os uteri, especially when the parts are
dry and hot, and the edges of the os are hard, thin and unyielding, where
nervous excitability is present. It soothes the general nervous system at
this time, overcomes erratic, sharp, cutting, nagging pains, that seem to be
of no benefit, preserves the integrity of the nerve force, and if the pains are
exaggerated, and the labor does not advance, the labor is sometimes satisfactorily suspended or retarded until all parts are ready for the expulsive effort.

It is a most soothing remedy after labor, relieving nervous excitability
and preventing or controlling after pains, but I do not consider it a proper
or safe remedy with which to control these pains, as I am confident that its
influence upon the normal muscular contractility of the uterine fibre, causes
relaxation, permits uterine hemorrhage, and retards normal involution. Dr.
Broadnax made this observation also.

It is a valuable remedy for hysteria. It is combined with pulsatilla to
advantage in young girls. In pregnant women with frequently recurring
paroxysms, macrotys, in small doses, will facilitate its action, as will viburnum or aletris.

Bloyer says ‘‘if the use of gelsemium be extended to those parts of the
organism involving unstriped muscular fiber, we will find that it acts directly
upon this class of muscles. These occur in the liver and its ducts; in the
kidneys and the ureter, the bladder and the urethra, as we find also, on the
womb and ovaries and in the heart. Upon the pelvic organs, especially if
used with pulsatilla, viburnum, helonias, or macrotys, its influence is satisfactory. It certainly conduces to the relief of high tension.’’

SEDATIVES USED IN ‘THE CONTROL OF FEVERS 7

In diseases of the nervous system of a chronic character, the influence
of gelsemium is beneficial, but not so pronounced. In excitable mania it
exercises a controlling influence, and if sleeplessness be present its influence
is enhanced by combination with hyoscyamus. It has exercised a beneficial
influence in epilepsy, especially in those cases where acute cerebral hyperemia is present.

This agent has its place in chorea, but only when its specific indications
are present, not in those cases characterized by anemia.

In the treatment of facial neuralgia, especially of the fifth pair, its
influence is pronounced. It should be used hypodermically over the sciatic
nerves in the treatment of sciatica. It controls headaches from cerebral
engorgement with nervous irritability and excitability.

It is a serviceable remedy for migraine and tic douloureux. In persistent stitchlike pains, in the deep muscles of the back, which often completely incapacitate a man for work of any kind, full doses, just short of
its apparent physiological action, will act in a most specific manner.

In rheumatic stiffness of the muscles of the neck, often accompanied
with sharp pain, this agent should be freely given. In acute rheumatism and
in rheumatic fever it is often sharply indicated. Given in connection with
aconite, bryonia or rhus tox, as these are indicated, no better treatment can
be instituted.

I consider gelsemium a most important heart remedy. The cases are
those of rapid heart from over excitability; from irritability, with exaltation
of nerve force, but where the patient is in full strength. No other remedy
need be given in some of these cases. It relieves palpitation so induced and
cures cardiac neuralgia. It is especially useful in the irritable heart of hysteria, influencing the entire train of symptoms at once. It is contra-indicated
in weak heart, and where there are valvular lesions of any considerable character.

In sea-sickness specific gelsemium has been used with marked success. A
teaspoonful of a mixture of thirty drops in four ounces of water is taken at the
time of sailing, and repeated hourly the first day. Afterward it is taken less
frequently. In this connection, be it said, in sea-sickness the remedy that cures
one person may fail in another, and it is not to be expected that gelsemium will
affect all alike.

I am inclined to the belief that in the South, its natural habitat, the conditions assumed by acute disease are more directly and specifically influenced by
gelsemium than in the colder climates. Perhaps those factors of disease in
which gelsemium is specifically indicated are more frequently induced or increased by the climatic influences of that locality. At least, our physicians in
the Soith, who use the remedy to any extent, use it much more freely, and
seem to find its indications present more often than we do in the North.

Recently a number of observations have been made on the action of
gelsemium in epilepsy. One writer used it with veratrum in his cases, and has
had unusually good results. He endeavors to anticipate the spasms, whenever
possible, and gives the remedies in combination between times.

Many physicians have treated stage fright, or fear in meeting the public,
or of students in fear of examinations, and have abolished it entirely with five
drop doses of gelsemium, repeated two or three times, according to the susceptibility of the patient. Aconite also acts well here, but in smaller doses.

In the treatment of tetanus, Dr. Lewis of Illinois prevented the development of three cases, with echinacea for the toxemia, and gelsemium and passifiora for the spasms, used by the mouth and hypodermically. Dr. Matthew
combined twenty drops each of gelsemium, phenol, and water as a hypodermic
injection. In twelve cases he injected this entire quantity every three to six

hours, saving all the patients. This combination has been subsequently used
with much success. In 1880 Dr. J. Marion Sims gave gelsemium for tetanus
and produced very satisfactory cures. He gave forty minims of the tincture
every hour or two, reducing it to twenty minims, as the convulsions decreased
and continuing this to full convalescence. In the tetanus of horses, it has been
frequently used, hypodermically, by veterinarians throughout America. They
claim that it cures many cases.

Dr. Smith, of Leesburg, Florida, told me that in the malarial disorders
which prevail in his locality he found indications for its use in nearly all acute
cases and almost invariably obtained prompt and satisfactory results. He has
occasion to prescribe larger quantities of it than of all other fever and sedative
remedies combined. Dr. Wm. M. Durham, of Atlanta, Georgia, and several
other physicians of the South confirmed Dr. Smith’s opinion as to the frequency
of the occurrence of its indications.

All these physicians unite in the opinion that gelsemium quickly brings
about that condition in periodical malarial disorders in which the antiperiodic,
quinine, can exercise its happiest influence. It restores secretion, softens and
slows the pulse, reduces nerve excitation and irritation, causes a mild transPiration from the skin, and assists in cleaning the tongue. All these conditions
must be present if quinine be given to marked advantage and with no unpleasant results.

These physicians claim further, that given during the time of the administration of quinine, it prevents undue stimulation of a sensitive nervous system,
does away entirely in most cases with the tinnitus aurium, and other unpleasant phenomena, and enhances the influence of the quinine in all lines of
its action, the desired effect being obtainable by a less quantity of this antiperiodic than would otherwise be required. These suggestions are no doubt
applicable in other localities to a degree.

I have heard physicians say that they believed there were times or seasons
when gelsemium influenced their patients with the same indications much
more directly and positively than at other times. Perhaps this is in line with
the theory of ‘‘epidemic remedial influence’’ or ‘‘epidemic remedial conditions’’ advanced by Rademacher and referred to by Scudder and other writers.

Co-operative Agents: Macrotys racemosa is an excellent remedy with
which to combine gelsemium where the muscular system is involved. It promotes the action of gelsemium in all heart troubles, and in irritable and inflammatory conditions of the entire urinary tract. Opium intensifies the
effects of this agent, but is slower in its action and its effects are not so
quickly dissipated. They are not often prescribed together by those who
are familiar with the action of gelsemium.

Lobelia and this agent will be found to act well together in certain selected
cases; in severe convulsive manifestations especially. When morphine is given
for relief of pain during powerful spasms, it acts as an antispasmodic. Gelsemium combined with it when indicated will be found to exercise all of its
influence and control the pain which would otherwise continue, and thus
prevent the antispasmodic effects of the remedy to an extent. Dr. Owen of
Texas dissolves one grain of morphine in 240 grains of specific gelsemium. He
gives this for premature labor pains in doses of from ten to fifteen drops, and
in other conditions where both remedies are indicated, he gives from ten to
boo drops, as in severe persistent lumbago, sometimes with immediate
results.

Other agents which act harmoniously with it to a greater or less extent
are passiflora incarnata, the bromides, and chloral hydrate, conium maculatum,
physostigma, veratrum, and Jamaica dogwood. It works nicely in fevers in
eareful combination with aconite..

Antagonists—This agent is antagonized by alcohol, by strychnine, nux
vomica, digitalis, ammonia and, to a certain extent, by caffeine and belladonna.

Antidotes—In overdoses, heat applied, with electricity, and alcoholic stimulants, friction, artificial respiration, and hypodermics of atropine or strych-.
nine should be administered. Strong coffee and the physiological salt solution
are active antidotes also.

Physiological Action—In a moderate dose of five minims of the tincture,
a sense of numbness and tingling is felt in the tongue and lips, with muscular
weakness and depression; by doubling the dose these symptoms are intensified
and prolonged, the pulse falls and the breathing is slowed. A poisonous dose
causes tingling in the skin, pain in the joints, vertigo, dimness of vision,
extreme debility, pulse forty to fifty per minute and irregular, skin cool and
moist, burning heat in the esophagus and stomach, nausea, vomiting and purging. There may be severe gastric and intestinal spasms, headache, complete
loss of sight, hearing and speech, while consciousness remains; pupils dilated.
muscles tremulous or convulsed, pulse imperceptible; death by syncope.

Aconite acts on the vaso-motor nervous system. It is a powerful depressant of the heart, and if given in sufficient quantity will paralyze that organ.
Its apparent influence is upon the terminal filaments of the sensory nerves first,
and afterwards, more slowly, upon the nerve trunks, It depresses the nerve
centers of the cord, and destroys reflex activity and voluntary power.

A drop of a solution of aconite in the eye causes the pupil to contract,
Larger amounts induce toxic symptoms, the principal of which are increase
of tingling and numbness, excessive perspiration, rapidly lowering temperature,
pupillary dilation, dimness of sight, loss of hearing and sense of touch, and
diminished action of the sensory filaments supplying the skin.

Muscular weakness is marked; trembling and occasional convulsions may
énsue. Excessive depression comes on, and the power of standing is early lost.
The feet and legs become cold, the face pale, and the patient has a tendency to
faint. There may be violent burning in the stomach with great thirst and
dyspagia, and vomiting and diarrhea may occur. The pulse is weak, rapid, and
almost imperceptible; acute, lancinating pain may be felt, and more or less
delirium may result, though as a rule the intellect remains unimpaired.

“‘The manner in which aconite affects the nervous system is not yet definitely known. That it is a heart paralyzer seems to be an accepted fact. Death
may result from syncope, though usually it occurs from respiratory paralysis.
The action of a lethal dose is rapid, toxic symptoms showing themselves within
afew moments.’’ (Lloyd and Felter.)

Administration—In my earlier teachings of the action of this agent, I
taught that it was a remedy for sthenic fevers only. I have since been convinced that its influence in very small and frequently repeated doses, greatly


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 65

80 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

broadens its application. Homeopathic physicians class it as one of the most
important agents and their dosage is always minute. In such dosage, with
small, feeble, frequent or corded pulse, in adynamic or asthenic fevers, it may
be given with excellent advantage.

It restores normal conditions, so strengthening the action of the heart as
to even bring a subnormal temperature, in some such cases as in cholera and
malignant intermittents up to the normal point. It acts in harmony with belladonna in equalizing the circulation, lessening determination of blood, increasing arterial tension and greatly improving the capillary circulation.

In sthenic fevers it may be given in larger doses, with a view to producing results which are in line with its physiological action. It is contraindicated in that dosage, however, when the sthenic stage is passed. It should
be given, if at all, in very small doses. One drop of the specific medicine in a
four ounce mixture, a teaspoonful every half hour or hour, will sometimes
produce the best results in patients under twelve years of age. In the sthenic
stage five drops of the specific on fifteen drops of the U. S. P. Tincture in a
four ounce mixture, to be given in dram doses hourly, is usually required.

So common is the use of aconite in fevers that all practitioners with
experience recognize the indications, One physician suggests that in intestinal
fevers the results are not so satisfactory, because of the fact that intestinal
toxemia is so persistent. If the intestinal tract can be thoroughly cleansed and
the toxemic influences removed, then the remedy acts as in other fevers. The
same is true of septicemia from local causes.

Specific Symptomatology— When the pulse is small, hard, quick and sharp,
the skin dry and hot, the secretions suddenly suppressed, the temperature rising, chilliness up and down the spinal column, a shivering when the bed coverings are moved, or from a slight draft, or on the least exposure, the agent
is directly indicated.

It is also indicated when the pulse is full and hard and sharp, with suppressed secretions in the initial stages of acute inflammation of any organ, and
at the onset of protracted fevers and especially of exanthematous diseases.

In asthenic fevers, which are usually protracted, the pulse small, feeble,
frequent, sometimes wiry and corded, with or without evidences of impairment
of the capillary circulation, the agent is specifically demanded, but in small
dosage. With these phenomena, its use may often be continued for a few
days, then discontinued to be resumed later as before, if needed.

In the early stages of local inflammatory disorders, which involve the
mucous membranes, where the secretions of these membranes are perverted or
suppressed, the agent in small doses is indicated. This condition is found in
laryngitis, tonsillitis and bronchitis, also in gastritis, colitis, or enteritis, and
especially in cholera infantum.

Therapy—Aconite has become the greatest of the agents used by the profession in the control of fever; but its indication must be complied with.

At the onset of fever Aconite is the remedy. At that stage of the disease
when the evidences of some disorder are apparent, and yet its localization cannot be determined, the indications for treatment pronounced, why should the
physician wait until a group of symptoms appears that has a name—that is
known as disease—when the indications for one remedy are so conspicuous?
‘We have known of many cases where all the evidences of approaching inflammation were plainly apparent, where the initial fever has been promptly met
with Aconite and no inflammatory condition has ever developed. It is the
experience of all physicians.

Aconite is specifically the fever remedy in childhood. Infants are susceptible to minute doses often repeated, and it is kind and soothing in its
action. Five drops of the tincture to four ounces of water given in teaspoonful


<!-- chunk -->

SEDATIVES USED IN THE CONTROL OF FEVERS 81

doses every hour is the usual maximum dose for a child one year of age. Because of its prompt action and ready elimination the doses must be given
frequently.

In severe fevers, it is better to give one half teaspoonful every half hour.
As soon as the sedative influence is apparent, the skin becomes moistened, the
restlessness abates and the temperature falls, the doses must be reduced in
size or in frequency until no longer indicated. Simple fevers will abate in from
four to twelve hours under this administration of Aconite.

Aconite promotes tone and power in the arterial capillaries, and is opposed
to blood stasis. In this influence it has a powerful auxiliary in belladonna.
The two agents, in small doses, work harmoniously in incipient inflammation.
Their combined influence in capillary engorgement is most salutary.

At the onset of inflammation, the synthetic heart depressants will perhaps
stay the fever, but their influence is not so benefically exercised upon the
inflammatory processes. If inflammation is in progress they will not dissipate
its results. Aconite retards pathologic exudation, suppuration, adhesion, induration and hypertrophy. This can by no means be as truly said of any other
agent. Aconite certainly antagonizes inflammation or inflammatory processes
and their results. It hastens resolution and promotes rapid absorption of
inflammatory products.

Under the influence of this agent there is an entire change in the heart’s
action. The heart beats more slowly and quietly, the pulse becomes fuller and
more natural, there is a general soothing effect upon the nervous centers, and
the natural secretions from all the emunctories are re-established. It promotes
free diaphoresis, and thus, 8 more rapid dissipation of heat. It is thus especially indicated when the skin is dry and hot. The mouth is no longer dry, the
eyes assume a more natural appearance, and there is a large increase of the
urinary secretion and the arterial tension is materially lessened. Aconite has
a direct effect on the heat centers, inducing marked reduction in temperature.
It is due to this influence that it is so reliable whenever there is an excess of
body heat.

In acute congestion or in inflammation of the brain and spinal cord or
their meninges, this agent exercises a double influence in the initial stages, but
as soon as prostration or lack of power is evidenced it must be discontinued.
In cerebro-spinal meningitis of infancy, with gelsemium and other antispasmodic sedatives, its influence is of prime importance. Acute discrimination
must be exercised as to the limits in which it will be useful.

With the statements made, concerning the action of this remedy, it will
be seen that ih the diseases of children, and especially during the summer,
aconite is more frequently called for perhaps, than any other one fever remedy.
The fevers resulting from heat, from gastric disturbances and intestinal faults,
as well also as those of nerve irritation from any cause occurring during warm
weather, nearly all show the aconite indications, and consequently respond very
quickly to this remedy.

Aconite has a direct influence on respiration afd upon the respiratory
organs. In pneumonitis its influence upon the capillary circulation is so pronounced that it is impossible to overlook its benefits. Usually for the first
five days of the fever its indications are conspicuous and no remedy will take
its place. If given with veratrum at this time the violence of the circulation
and temperature is restrained more promptly. In bronchitis it allays irritation, restores secretion, and by its paralyzing effect on the end nerve filaments
quickly soothes the irritable or inflamed condition of the mucous membrane.

In pleuritis it is the first remedy to be thought of in the initial stage. Its
influence is enhanced here by the use of asclepias tuberosa, and by alternation
with bryonia. The chilliness, cutting pain on respiration, sharp cough and dry


<!-- chunk -->

skin and mucous membranes, all point directly to it; but as soon as effusion
to any great extent occurs, the agent may be dropped and the other agents continued.

It is of essential value in the treatment of mucous and serous inflammations. Its influence is evidenced in a marked manner in the treatment of acute
enteritis or peritonitis, local or diffused, idiopathic, traumatic or septic. In
gastritis, appendicitis and hepatitis; in acute nephritis, cystitis or urethritis,
specific or non-specific, it is the first indicated remedy and may be continued
until asthenia appears. In acute catarrh and other similar inflammations it
may be persisted in as long as the inflammation lasts.

Its influence in stomach and intestinal troubles is in part due, although
to no great extent, to its local as well as its general influence. In the inflammatory stage of dysentery and cholera infantum minute doses of ipecac and
aconite exercise a specific effect when the causes of the disease are removed
and intestinal asepsis secured.

In the onset of diphtheria it is an essential auxiliary. In acute tonsilitis,
pharyngitis or laryngitis its specific influence is conspicuous because of its local
as well as its constitutional effects. Minute doses will often abort a case of
croup or terminate it abruptly. Its internal administration in acute inflammation of the throat or post-nasal mucous membrane is greatly enhanced by a
warm spray which contains aconite in an appreciable quantity.

In the treatment of continued or septic fevers aconite is usually indicated
at the onset, but as soon as impairment of the blood, by the influence of high
temperature and rapid destructive metabolism, with defective excretion of the
waste products, is apparent, the agent must be discarded. The nerve force is
deficient by this time and depressing agents are contra-indicated. This is
especially true in typhoid conditions. The changes take place early, and the
period of aconite indications is very short. Cactus grand, organic antiseptics
and bryonia will produce a sedative influence, and we will find their indications
conspicuous when the time for aconite has passed.

Aconite is of value in the treatment of rheumatism and rheumatic fever.
In addition to its general influence upon inflammatory conditions it is a great
promoter of excretion. It is combined to an advantage with macrotys, sodium
salicylate, bryonia, or rhus tox.

In exanthematous disease aconite is doubly indicated because of its direct
action upon the capillary circulation of the skin. It assists in determining the
eruption to the surface and promoting exfoliation. It curbs the temperature
and prevents complications and conduces to a normal condition of the mucous
surfaces, which is important where those surfaces are in danger of being
involved also.

In acute mastitis, if treatment be inaugurated at once, an actual specific
effect is accomplished by administering a full dose of aconite with ten drops of
the tincture of phytolacca decandra, one hour, and alternating it the next hour
with aconite and ten grains of acetate of potassium. But few doses will be
given until abatement of the active symptoms will be observed. The same
course may be advised in prostatitis or acute orchitis with similar results. In
metritis it has a prompt influence and gives excellent satisfaction.

Aconite is a remedy of prime importance in the treatment of amenorrhea
when the suppression results from acute cold. It is conjoined with other
measures indicated, and is prompt and satisfactory. Macrotys enhances its
influence here, as well as polygonum punctatum. When the secretion of the
skin and mucous membrane is restored by aconite, a full dose of quinine will
sometimcs accomplish the desired result, when it would accomplish nothing
without this agent.

SEDATIVES USED IN THE CONTROL OF FEVERS 83

Aconite is so assuredly a specific in febrile conditions that its influence
in chronic diseases is almost entirely overlooked. It is in certain chronic and
non-febrile conditions a very reliable remedy because of its certain action upon
the nervous system. John King advised its use in treatment of non-febrile
spinal irritation in young women, and the writer has followed his suggestions
in this condition for years with superior results in many cases.

Its direct influence upon the cerebro-spinal system is recognized by
homeeopathists, Deschere says: ‘‘Aconite is useful in mental diseases and
hysteria when there is particular aversion to excitement; the patients show an
intolerance of music; they can bear no sounds.”’

Aconite is an important remedy in the treatment of affections of the heart.
The symptoms indicating it in these cases are numerous and important, and
necessarily so, since aconite restrains the blood flow and also exerts a special
action on the heart and its nerves. There are congestions of both heart and
lungs, palpitation with anxiety, cardiac oppression and even syncope. The
palpitation is worse when walking, lancinating stitches occur and prevent the
patient from assuming an erect posture or taking a deep inspiration. Attacks
of intense pain at times extend down the left arm from the heart and are associated with numbness and tingling in the fingers.

The agent is advised by many in angina pectoris when there are strong
contractions or pure hypertrophy, but not in enfeebled heart or where there is
much valvular insufficiency.

In reflex vomiting without prostration or exhaustion aconite is useful.
This is especially true in some cases of the vomiting of pregnancy.

In neuralgia it is of use externally as well as internally. The aconitine, in
granules, is the best form for its internal administration in neuralgia. Externally the tincture may be applied.

Webster has used aconite externally for pruritus, with excellent results.
Oceasionally the condition returns but in most cases the cure has remained
permanent. Harrington confirms Webster’s observations as does Robinson,
who believes that the influence is induced by a direct anesthetic effect at first,
with an influence upon the nerve endings, which prevents a return of the condition. The remedy is diluted and applied according to the discretion and
knowledge of the physician.

Aconite is of common use in local pain, to relieve congestion, irritation and
distress, Perhaps the most immediate influence obtainable in acute pain is to
pour ten drops each of chloroform and aconite into the palm of the hand and
hold it over the seat of the pain for two or three minutes. The effect is
instantaneous and marvelous. It may be used in this manner in acute stomach
or bowel pains until the cause of the pain is removed by other measures, or
in acute pleurisy, and especially in angina pectoris. The pain ends with the
application, and measures can be adopted to prevent its recurrence. Any
local pain or neuralgia will yield, for a time at least, and in some cases it will
not return. Sciatica treated two or three times per week with this simple
formula will sometimes cease to return.

We have observed that aconite intensifies, modifies and otherwise improves
the action of several other agents with which it may be combined or alternated.
The characteristic effects of Macrotys racemosa will occur in much less
time with this remedy than when given alone. The influence of belladonna
upon all local congestions and in equalizing general circulation is intensified
in a characteristic manner when the remedy is given with, or alternated with
aconite. Given in proper doses with veratrum the influence of both remedies
is active. Their influence on serous inflammation is most marked. In many
cases either alone will not produce the same results.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 69

84 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Given with gelsemium in nervous excitement, cerebral fullness, nervous
twitchings and fevers which result from irritation of the nerves and nerve
centers, the effects of both are heightened.

Given with asclepias tuberosa, with proper external means, hardly any
other agent will be needed in acute pleuritis.

Veterinarians find aconite immensely beneficial in the treatment of the
inflammatory diseases of animals; but objections arise in the treatment of
disease in horses, from the fact that horses are much more susceptible to its
action than man. A correspondingly smaller dose must be given, and repeated
quite often.

Toxicity—Poisoning by aconite is not common. An overdose produces
in the mouth and throat a tingling sensation, followed by symptoms of strangulation from paralysis of the nerve endings. The tingling becomes quickly general. This is followed by a sensation of numbness. The skin, relaxing, becomes
covered with cold sweat, and finally becomes cold. The patient becomes too
weak to stand, the respiration is greatly depressed and insufficient, the heart
beats more feebly and the pulse may vary every few minutes in its character,
but it is always weak. The temperature falls rapidly. Aconite depresses the
heat centers, and, by dilating the capillaries of the skin, permits rapid heat
radiation, thus at the same time, acting in a two-fold manner upon the temperature. Consequently the temperature of the surface of the body is a fairly
correct criterion by which to judge of the internal temperature.

There may be vomiting, failure of the special senses from the general
paralyzing effect of the agent, syncope or mild delirum and convulsions.
These symptoms are not usual.

Antidotes—If a full toxic dose be taken, the above symptoms advance
most rapidly, and no time whatever should be lost in combating the influence
of the agent. It has no known physiological antidote. The conditions must be
met according to their indications. If there is any reason for believing that the
stomach contains any of the agent, large quantities of warm water should be
swallowed and immediately evacuated. It may be vomited or siphoned out
with a long stomach tube, or pumped out, but extreme nauseating emetics are
contra-indicated. A mild infusion of oak bark, drunk freely, serves the double
purpose of diluting the aconite and antidoting it by the tannin it contains.
Tannic acid is believed to be a chemical antidote to a limited extent, and given
in suspension in water is efficient.

The most immediately diffusible stimulants must then be given freely.
Alcoholic stimulants, ammonia, capiscum, in a hot infusion, and digitalis,
strophanthus or atropine by hypodermic injection, or nitro-glycerine are most
serviceable remedies. External heat continually and electricity are demanded.
I think lobelia will prove valuable also.

are increased in severity, the pulse becomes almost imperceptible, the skin cold
and clammy together with vomiting, retching, hiccough, faintness, dizziness,
blindness and unconsciousness. These symptoms indicate that the drug is a
powerful spinal and cerebral depressant.

Although veratrum is a powerful poison, it is so regular and uniform in its
action, and so devoid of erratic and unaccountable or uncontrollable influences,
that it can be given within the limits of its maximum dosage with safety.

In overdoses it produces vomiting, usually before enough is absorbed to
produce serious results. It is not rapid or violent in its first effects and is
not cumulative. It is quickly eliminated and the effects of single doses are
transient. It can be watched even when the doses are large, and stopped before harm results. It is really the safest of our active agents. Its poisonous
effects are easily antidoted. It is better given in small doses, repeated every
half hour or hour, in acute cases, as its influence is exercised in a more uniform
manner, is more permanent, is more easily controlled and is not so apt to disturb the stomach. A large dose produces quick depression, although the effect
is transient. If the dose be often repeated, the stomachie irritation quickly
becomes so great as to interfere with all medication.

Veratrum is a better remedy for adults than for children. It is not as
easily adapted to infants and the feeble as aconite, and its manner of action is
not as satisfactory.

Veratrum, in its direct heart depression, resembles the coal-tar depressants,
although much more regular and uniform in its action and perfectly controllable. It steadily slows the heart and circulation, the temperature declining
correspondingly. Its influence upon the emunctories is not marked. Aconite
influences the heat production and heat-radiation, stimulates all emunctories
and the function of all the glandular organs and hastens the removal of inflammatory products. Effusion or suppuration are thus prevented, and if this
agent is begun early, when the temperature has declined, there will be no local
lesions remaining to contend with as the results of the inflammatory action.

Veratrum will assist in the removal of morbific products, but not with the
immediate influence upon the results of inflammatory actions that are apparent
from the use of aconite. It is an active eliminant which provides for its
own elimination. Veratrum should not be given when inflammation has resulted
in marked structural change and the products of inflammation are plainly
present. Here aconite may be given as long as no general depression occurs.

Specific Symptomatology—Veratrum is indicated in the onset of sthenic
fever when the pulse is full, large and bounding, and the tissues are engorged,
where there is fullness of the capillary circulation.

It is especially serviceable when there seems to be obstruction of the
venous capillary circulation. The face and skin are flushed, but usually of a
full, dull, dark hue, and not always the bright-red flush with hot, dry skin
which indicates aconite and gelsemium. The following indications suggest it.

Tongue coated white or yellow with a red streak down the center.

Congestion that occurs at the base of the brain.

Convulsions that occur as a result of septicemia.

Tissues full, not shrunken; marked arterial throbbing with bloodshot eyes.

Erysipelas appearing like ordinary inflammation (red).

The akin is usually soft and covered with warm perspiration. In these
cases Veratrum reduces the arterial pressure and permits, or even assists, the
more rapid removal of the venous obstruction.

In administering veratrum, because of its direct action on the heart it is
necessary, if given for a short time only, in full doses, that the patient remain
in a recumbent position. In sthenic inflammations, especially such as results
from infections, and this includes a long list, and exophthalmic goitre, it


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 71

86 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

exercises a most delightful influence when given in small doses, frequently repeated, the patients should thus get the best results when in a recumbent position, but that position is not then obligatory.

Therapy—The characteristic indications for veratrum are found in the
onset of pneumonitis in strong men previously healthy and vigorous. In these
cases, given in doses of a drop of the tincture every half hour, it will slow the
pulse and slowly reduce the temperature after four or five hours. This effect
can be continued for a few doses longer, and then the doses should be smaller
or given farther apart. The pulse should be slowed, in a case with violent
premonitory symptoms, down to the normal beat and held there for awhile,
and if the symptoms do not quickly abate, the influence may be continued
until a pulse of sixty or fifty-five, or even, in a strong man, fifty beats is
reached, if the stomach be not yet irritated.

In pleuritis, in bronchitis, in peritonitis, especially pelvic peritonitis from
sepsis; in hepatitis and nephritis and cystitis always at the beginning of the
acute stage before much structural change has occurred, it may be given, and
will retard and often throw off the attack. It is of value in the earlier stages
of meningitis and cerebritis, if given understandingly. If the violent heart
action be controlled, the processes of disease and any tendency to convulsive
action will be at once restrained.

In continued fevers this agent, like other depressants of nerve force, is
not always the best remedy to use. The reactionary power of the nerve centers
is greatly lowered by disease, and if depressants are given they are apt to still
further decrease the nerve force and minimize its restorative influence over the
system. Advantage will sometimes follow its early use in a case of extremely
high temperature with violent and noisy delirium, but it is not the remedy to
persist in nor to continue when the prostrating influence of the fever is
apparent.

In tonsillitis aconite as an internal remcdy is almost specific, but its
influence is greatly heightened and the inflammatory stage shortened by applying veratrum with a camel’s-hair pencil over the tonsils. Diluted—one dram
in a half-glass of water—it is an excellent gargle in any inflamed throat. In
these cases it aborts the inflammation and determines immediate resolution.

In erysipelas it is of value both internally and externally. For external
use in this disease a somewhat dilute non-alcoholic preparation is preferable,
or the fluid extract, full strength or diluted one-half.

It is seldom that other applications will be needed, and the force and
frequency of the hcart’s action can well be restrained by its internal use. If
begun early in erysipelas, there are few conditions likely to arise that will
contraindicate its use.

The first investigators into the properties of veratrum pronounced it an
excellent alterative. It has not been generally used as such, but those who
have so used it have expressed the strongest confidence in it. Prof. A. L. Clark,
writing on the subject in 1889, said: ‘‘As an alterative, especially as an antisyphilitic remedy, there is no better agent in the vegetable kingdom. Indeed,
there is room for doubt whether the animal, vegetable or mineral kingdoms
furnish a better remedy in purely syphilitic cases. If the patient has been
already saturated with mercury, as is too often the case, doubtless the administration of some of the preparations of iodine will be a necessary adjuvant. In
the uncomplicated secondary forms of the disease it will be seldom that any
other remedy will produce as satisfactory results as can be obtained with the
veratrum alone.

Of a reliable fluid extract four or five drops three times a day will be
usually well borne by the stomach, and the sensitiveness of that organ is my
sole guide in dosage. If four drops disturb the stomach use three for a few

days, then increase to four, then perhaps to five. Its smallness of bulk, not disagreeable taste, and, above all, its satisfactory effects, constitute strong recommendations for its use.’’ Perhaps its power in this line increases its efficacy in
the treatment of pucrperal convulsions.

Its alterative and eliminative influence as well as its sedative power
caused the older writers to say that veratrum would positively cure puerperal
fever.

Other observers have spoken most highly of its action in developing
phthisis pulmonalis. Positive claims are made that, judiciously administered, it has aborted the disease.

While I have spoken against its use in continued fevers, there are several
writers who have given it in full doses at the onset of typhoid fever, while
sthenia was yet present, and have had most salutary results.

In the early stages of acute rheumatism, its indications are present sometimes quite conspicuously, and if given in emphatic doses, it will sometimes
quickly terminate the disorder. In articular rheumatism, it may be applied
freely, externally, over the swollen and inflamed joints.

In the treatment of rheumatic fever, one writer says that when with the
fever there is rapid strong pulse, caused by the toxines, veratrum used as a
sedative is especially valuable because of its alterative properties, exercising a double influence, removing the causes of the disorder as satisfactorily
as any other known remedy. ’

It is given in sthenic inflammations with the above symptoms, in erysipelas with general symptoms of inflammation, with a red stripe through the
center of the tongue; in nervous irritation, with threatened convulsions;
usually those which have suddenly appeared. In these cases the pulse is
rapid, but may be full, or it may be corded or sharp, hard and wiry.

In cases where there is previous gastric irritation, usually shown by a
long, narrow and pointed tongue, with red tip and red edges, the agent will
not be of benefit, but will increase that condition. Where there is nausea
from the presence of undigested or foreign matter in the stomach, the rapid
pulse, etc., being present, its action may be beneficial. In these cases the
tongue is usually pale, broad and thick.

For bilious colic Dr. Bates wrote some years ago that he relied upon this

There are some cases of chorea in which veratrum will serve an excellent
purpose. These cases are more or less acute in development, and are usually
very violent. The heart: is irritable and the pulse rapid.

Dr. Woodward speaks very highly of veratrum in the treatment of asthma.
In spasmodic cases he is confident of its beneficial influence, but he has given
it principally in those sthenic heart cases where asthmatic breathing has developed within a few days and persists. He gives one or two drops every
hour unless unfavorable symptoms occur. He expects favorable results within
a few hours. It is a remedy for some cases of hay asthma,

The old writers cautioned against giving large doses of quinine and veratrum, at the same time, as their influences were antagonistic, and Dr. Percy
claimed that it was a positive antidote to strychnine poisoning, quickly controlling the spasms and assisting the elimination of the poison.

A satisfactory cure of tetanus, with veratrum and gelsemium, has been
reported. The case was one of a young girl, 14 years old, attacked after an
operation, for the removal of the ovaries, with a most severe form of tetanus.
The case presented the classic symptoms in the extreme. When paraldehyde,
morphine, chloral and the bromides had failed, the antitetanic serum was used.
This also failed, and the patient was put upon veratrum. Small doses failing, larger doses were given in conjunction with gelsemium. Eight minims

of each every hour was given per rectum. The effect was prompt and satisfactory, but the agent was discontinued because of vomiting, when the symptoms returned. Ten minims of veratrum and eight minims of gelsemium were
then given every hour, and the symptoms were promptly controlled. There
is no doubt that the powerful alterative properties of veratrum, add greatly to
its efficacy in the control of tetanic and puerperal convulsions.

It is useful in acute gonorrhea, preventing chordee and abating the activity of the symptoms. It is as useful also in orchitis from whatever cause.

It is a valuable application in localized inflammation, such as boils, carbuneles, felons, ulcers with heat and swelling, ‘‘cold sores’’ on the lips and
inflamed pimples.

The use of veratrum as an antispasmodic is now quite common. It may
be given in convulsions with active cerebral hyperemia. It is especially reliable as an emergency remedy in persistent cases of convulsions in childhood
while the cause is being removed, its influence often assisting in the removal
of the cause. From one drop to three or four may be given at a single dose,
according to the age of the child, and repeated with caution.

In puerperal convulsions the mass of evidence in favor of veratrum is
overwhelming. One old physician reported in the Medical Record (1888) an
experience in the treatment of an average of eight cases per year for twentyeight years, without the loss of a patient, with veratrum alone. Another treated
twenty-three cases with veratrum, with recovery in all. In these cases full
doses are given, closely watching the effects on the stomach, if given per
os, and always watching its effects upon the heart. A dose of five drops
can be repeated every half hour for three or four doses. At times five drops
have been given every half hour for four or five hours. This important influence is exercised through its power to control blood pressure—reducing
arterial tension. It is best used hypodermically.

In many severe cases with active cerebral engorgement as much as fifteen
drops have been given hypodermically and repeated after a time.

Three drops of the tincture of veratrum twice daily, gradually increasing the dose to twelve drops, then gradually reducing, may be given with
care in a desperate case of exophthalmic goiter with tachycardia. This agent
at such a time is important. It will usually control the rapidity of the pulse
in a satisfactory manner while it materially assists in antidoting the toxins,
and thus conduces to the action of other indicated remedies.

In its influence upon exalted activity of the heart, veratrum is of service
in palpitation from temporarily increased functional power of the heart—
the irritable heart of otherwise strong, vigorous men—the violent action induced by the use of tobacco in some cases inducing high arterial pressure and
the palpitation of hypertrophy without valvular incompetence. It is likewise valuable in aneurism, restraining hyperactivity by reducing the vasomotor tonus. In these cases a dose of from three to four drops four times
each day will do better than the small and frequently repeated dose.

logical Action—In large doses bryonia is an active hydragogue
cathartic and sometimes causes inflammation of the stomach and bowels. In
poisonous doses it causes a fall of temperature, dizziness, delirium, weak pulse,
cold perspiration, dilated pupils and other evidences of a depressing action
on the nervous system. The recent root is highly irritant when locally applied, and capable of producing vesication. The results from laboratory observations of this agent do not to any degree suggest its clinical adaptions.
These have been determined by the closest of clinical observation.

Specific Symptomatology—The following symptoms demand the use of
bryonia: Distress or pain in acute inflammatory disease, which is aggravated
by movement increased by pressure; elevated temperature, with hard, frequent, vibratile pulse; the muscular structures sore and tender, as if bruised;
acute lung or bronchial disorders, with no expectoration, dry cough, short
and harsh, or hacking, with soreness increased by coughing; flushed right
cheek, frontal pain extending to the basilar region; irritating cough.

Again: Sharp, cutting, lancinating or tearing pain from serous inflammation; increased muscular tension, and tenderness on pressure, aggravated
by motion; headache on the right side; inflamed lung structure, with pain
and soreness relieved by lying on the inflamed side, usually with a bright
spot on one cheek. Chronic soreness in the chest, without fever, with harsh,
dry, sharp cough. With this latter indication its influence is often enhanced
by alternation with small doses of belladonna.

Bryonia promotes the elimination of heat, and like aconite, it opposes
the dryness of the mucous membranes induced by inflammation which suspends secretion. It acts upon all serous membranes directly as stated. It
also acts upon the viscera covered by these membranes. It is thus valuable
in enteritis, in the inflammation of the glandular organs, and in pulmonary
and bronchial inflammations, always looking for its precise indications—tenderness on pressure, tiny shooting pains, or pain increased by motion.

The absorption of inflammatory products, either of a serous or sanguineous character, is greatly facilitated by this remedy. It opposes the
breaking down of tissue and pus formation. Its influence upon inflammatory
processes and upon the results of inflammation is even more positive in certain cases than aconite.

Therapy—Bryonia is a remedy of great value in the treatment of all
acute inflammations of the thoracic viscera or of the pleura. In pleuritis its
indications are usually all present. Uncomplicated cases will yield to this
agent alone. Occasionally, though, more rapid results will be accomplished
by alternating it with aconite or with asclepias tuberosa. It must be continued if effusion be present.

One physician, in two cases of pleurisy where there was at least a pint
of serum in the pleural sac of each, gave bryonia alone, and persistently
using it for a reasonable time, the entire quantity in both cases was absorbed,
and the patient made an excellent recovery.

In bronchitis, with short, quick cough, with quick, sharp pains, especially if the sputum be bloody or frothy, bryonia acts directly. It should
be given in small doses, at short intervals, and should be persisted in. It
will subdue the pain and the cough promptly and exercise as marked an
effect on the fever as any special sedative known.

In pneumonitis it may be positively indicated. If used in combination
with other specific remedies, abatement of the symptoms will be even more
rapid in these cases. Although opposed to complex medication, the author
has used the following combination in these conditions in infants and children
with the most happy results. The two prescriptions should be given as speci-

I have in late years been using bryonia in acute neuritis. I have found
in many cases the precise indications for the use of this remedy, and in one
exceedingly bad case, I got excellent results, indeed, but I combined it with
Mag. Phos. 3x, though the indications for bryonia alone were very plain.

Dr. Henderson specifies a form of neuralgia of the face, usually on the
right side caused by cold or from a draft with dull pain and stiffness or tenderness of the muscles, especially if there should be a sharp catch under the
right shoulder or in the right side increased by inspiration as immediately
relieved by a combination of bryonia and sticta, ten drops of each in four
ounces of water, a teaspoonful every half hour.

Bryonia controls the temperature and the fever processes, when the exact
indications are present, as positively as any of the other known special sedatives.

Synovitis with sharp pains on motion wherever located, demands bryonia, and rheumatic conditions, where the distress is increased by movement,
with sudden, sharp pains, especially where there is acute rheumatic swelling
of the finger joints, it is demanded. The fevers of infancy, where movement
causes pain, evidenced by sharp, crying out; inflammation of any organ, accompanied with sharp stabbing pain or stitches, a sensation of fullness and
deep soreness are controlled by it.

In protracted fevers, with dry mucous membranes, cracked lips, excessive
thirst; constipation, with hard, dry stools; scanty urine, with dark color and
high specific gravity, bryonia should be given, and in asthenic fevers the
remedy in small doses may be persisted in, with no depressing influence upon
the patient.

In chronic disorders of the liver or spleen, with deep-seated soreness and
quick, shooting pains, especially if there be some elevation of the temperature,
it will produce the best of results.

It should invariably be used in acute appendicitis from the appearance
of the first indications. I am convinced that we have no more important or
efficient remedy than this in this disorder. It will save many operations if
given early.

In a most obscure case, in consultation at one time, I discovered extreme
tenderness on pressure over the pancreas—little shooting pains—pain increased by motion, the patient lying immovable on the back, temperature
of 10144 degrees. I diagnosed acute pancreatitis. The patient was certainly
near death. The persistent use of bryonia relieved every condition in a satisfactory manner, causing me to conclude that the diagnosis was correct, and
that we had prevented the formation of pus by the prompt use of this remedy.
When these indications pointing to the pancreas are present in diabetes, this
remedy should be given.

Dr. Jones says that bryonia is the remedy for inflammation of the mammary glands when those glands are of stony hardness, pale, hot, painful and
sore, when they must be supported. He says that it is a remedy for headache
when it is of a bursting character, as if the head would split, worse on movement or on stooping over, relieved by lying still. He has found where a
patient suffers from nose bleed at the time of menstruation, that bryonia,
given in small doses, will restore the normal condition.

I am so confident of the action of this remedy in cough, especially in children, that with many patients suffering from no other trouble but a dry,
hacking, persistent cough with or without some irritation and soreness, I am
apt to give bryonia as the first remedy, or I combine it with any other simple, directly-indicated remedy.

_Aveiary measures should be adopted as the character of the case suggests.

In peritonitis with quick, sharp pains, flushed face and anxious coun.
tenance, bryonia is indicated. This agent, in mild cases, will subdue all the
inflammatory processes and control the pain satisfactorily without opium.

During the early stages of any inflammation in which bryonia seems to
be indicated, aconite will facilitate its action and assist in the control of the
processes, but bryonia can be continued to most excellent advantage when
the results of inflammation are extreme, and weakness and prostration are
present, when aconite might have a depressing effect and be contra-indicated.

In acute pericarditis and endocarditis the specific indications for this
agent are often present, and its influence is prompt. It will be of great service
if there is effusion with evidences of decreasing power of the heart.

In acute rheumatic inflammation of the heart or pericardium it is one of
the most direct remedies. Properly combined with indicated auxiliary measures, no remedy will act more satisfactorily.

It is of much value in typhoid conditions, especially in typhoid pneumonia or in pleuropneumonia or broncho-pneumonia with typhoid complications. In typhoid fever with severe enteric symptoms this agent is often of
great service in restraining the retrograde processes and controlling excessive
temperature. In septic fevers its influence will be marked and valuable. In
septic peritonitis it may be given alternately with aconite, or aconite and
echinacea, the latter remedy directly controlling the sepsis.

Bryonia is indicated in rheumatic fever and in acute rheumatic arthritis.
It must be given as in other acute conditions, in small doses frequently repeated. In muscular rheumatism and in rheumatic muscular pains it will accomplish good results if given in conjunction with macrotys or alternated
with cimifuga and aconite. In acute rheumatism of the joints of the fingers
or hand, it seems to be of value.

Because of its direct action on serous membranes, a few years ago I was
led, from the extreme tenderness and pain on pressure, to prescribe bryonia
for spinal tenderness. I immediately found that I had made the important
discovery of one of the best remedies with which to relieve that serious condition. Indications for other remedies will suggest their combination in some
eases, especially when this condition is present during pregnancy.

In mastitis or orchitis it is useful, and if the fever be high, the pains
sharp and cutting and the face flushed, the influence will be prompt, indeed.
In these cases, it is seldom given alone, but usually with aconite, phytolacca
or other direct remedies.

RHUS. RHUS TOXICODENDRON.

Synonyms—Rhus Radicans, Poison Oak, Poison Ivy.

Locality—North America.

ConstITUENTS—Toxicodendric Acid, fixed oil wax, tannin, mucilage.

PrREPARATIONS—Specific rhus tox. Dose from one-twentieth to two minims.

In the preparation of the specific rhus, the freshly gathered mature leaves
are used. It is at first green in color, afterward light-brown or yellowish. It is
volatile, and irritating to many. From two to ten drops in four ounces of water
is the usual administration. A tincture of rhus is prepared, but it varies
according to its manufacture and the quality of the drug used, and is not reliable.
Dose, from one-tenth to two minims.

Physiological Action—Most persons are poisoned by handling the poison
oak and the several poisonous varieties of rhus—rhus toxicodendron or radicans,
rhus venenata and rhus pumilium. It causes an erysipelatous inflammation of
the skin, the swelling sometimes being so excessive as to obliterate the features,
or the body may become so greatly swollen that the person is unable to move.
Internally in poisonous doses of the berries it causes drowsiness, stupor, vomiting,
convulsions, delirium, dilated pupils, hurried respiration, pulse at first full and
strong, finally small, frequent, feeble. Poisoning by an infusion of the root
causes a vesicular eruption, burning in the throat and cesophagus, dry, hoarse
cough, nervous twitching and wandering of the mind, constriction of the temples,
chilliness, nausea, thirst, debility, faintness and convulsions.

It relieves cerebral engorgement by increasing arterial pressure. In minute
doses it acts as a cerebral sedative to the overworked and irritable brain and
improves its tone and functional activity. It acts somewhat similarly to strychnine in that it produces increased functional activity of terminal nerve filaments
and is beneficial in some forms of paralysis.

Specific Symptomatology—In inflammatory fevers with sharp hard pulse;
acute inflammation involving the skin, with bright circumscribed redness, extreme soreness or sharp burning pain; extreme redness of local parts inflamed,
with great local heat and sharp pain; sharp supra-orbital pain, especially of the
left orbit; burning in the eyes with flushed face; inflammation with constitutional
impairment, evidenced by a sharp red tongue and deep red mucous membranes,
The tongue has a pointed tip upon which the papille are elongated and pointed.
In subacute or in chronic disease also with the above specific evidences, it is
demanded.

The differential diagnostic points between rhus and bryonia, are that rhus
is the remedy when the patient suffers most when warm and at rest, or when
the distress is aggravated by heat, while bryonia is indicated when the distress
is increased by motion. One prominent homepathic writer is authority for the
statement that it has direct influence upon the tendons, sheaths of the nerves
and fascie, hence its influence in rheumatism. Restlessness seems to be a leading
indication for rhus, as a specific agent. Whether it be a meningeal irritation
or ‘‘rheumatism,’’ the patient shows this same symptom. In many respects
in its indications rhus is the opposite of belladonna.

Therapy—The indications for this remedy are present in acute erysipelas
to a marked degree, especially in erysipelas of the head and face, or that involving loose cellular tissue. If it be given in the first stages of this disease the
symptoms abate rapidly. If typhoid symptoms be present in erysipelas it is
an excellent agent, its influence being marked upon typhoid conditions. It is
useful in typhoid fever and in typhoid conditions complicating acute inflammations. It seems to exercise the influence of a special sedative in these cases when
aconite and veratrum are contraindicated. Sordes with dry red tongue and dry


<!-- chunk -->

SEDATIVES USED IN THE CONTROL OF FEVERS 93

mucous membranes, flushed face, bright restless eyes, with tympanites, all demand rhus. It soothes the cerebral irritation of typhoid; inducing rest and
quiet, and controls delirium. It has antiseptic properties also which antagonize
the disease processes within the blood. It prevents disintegration of the red
blood corpuscles, and increases the vital powers.

In scarlet fever, measles and smallpox the indications for this agent are
often conspicuous, and it will be found of first importance, especially if there be
great injection of the conjunctiva, swelling of the palpebre, extreme lachrymation and photophobia. In the latter stages of these diseases when the skin is
livid, the tongue red, or red and glazed, with offensive breath, and offensive
discharges, and with failing vitality, it is demanded.

In acute inflammatory rheumatism the indications for rhus are conspicuous.
The agent is often of first importance in this disease. It may be alternated with
aconite or other suggested remedy for the fever, or if there be deep muscular
soreness, with macrotys. Its value in all forms of rheumatism is great, and
cannot be explained on the basis of its physiological action, as the homeopathists
obtain excellent results from very minute doses. It is given in chronic rheumatism and to relieve the results of rheumatic inflammation.

In persistent dry, tickling bronchial coughs rhus is a good remedy,
whether they be acute or chronic. It is combined with or alternated with
bryonia or aconite in capillary bronchitis with these characteristic coughs.

Dr. Hurd claims that when Lagrippe first made its appearance, the first
two cases had a guiding symptom that caused him to give full doses of rhus tox.
The patient would seize the head with both hands and groan as if he were
in agony. This peculiar frontal headache was relieved within an hour by this
remedy, establishing a line of investigation for its use.

The use of this remedy in small doses, internally, frequently repeated with
rhus poisoning, has long been advised. The experience of the editor has confirmed the belief that it is of benefit.

When gastric or intestinal disorders in children induce cerebral engorgement with great restlessness and flushed face, the specific tongue, mouth and
mucous membrane indications being present, rhus is the remedy. These cerebral
symptoms may be induced by any inflammatory disease, and successfully cured
with rhus. In adults they are found in prolonged adynamic fevers, and often
are a serious complication. Rhus will meet other prominent indications often
while correcting the brain phenomena.

It has an antispasmodic influence, preventing spasms when induced by
cerebral engorgement, or irritation which is of reflex origin or caused by gastric
or intestinal irritation, the characteristic indications for the remedy being present. Webster says he values it more highly than gelsemium or lobelia in infantile
convulsions, if its indications are present.

In gastro-intestinal disturbances accompanying the inflammatory conditions
* over which rhus has an especial influence, this agent is a direct sedative. It
arrests nervous and reflex vomiting promptly, and vomiting from any cause when
the tongue is pointed with reddened tip and edges. The so-called ‘‘strawberry tip’’ directly suggests rhus. In acute abdominal pain, in cholera morbus, with extreme vomiting and spasmodic pain, this agent is valuable.

In local inflammations, induration and swelling tending to suppuration, as
of boils, felons and carbuncle, the indications point to this remedy, and given
internally its influence is often excellent. In ulcerations with red areas and red
edges, in scrofulous indurations and ulcerations, it is useful. In eczematous
and erythematous conditions it is of value. It is of service in parotitis and in
inflammation of the sub-maxillary glands.

This agent must be used continually, and the prescriber must familiarize
himself with all its side influences before he can fully appreciate its great value.

In pruritus of the vulva or other localities where there is erythema, with
redness, persistent in some cases, especially with blonde cbildren with eczematous
Laie or children of a scrofulous diathesis, this agent is most prompt and
valuable.

There is a form of eczema, usually acute in character with the inflammatory evidences of burning, redness, itching, and perhaps swelling, that rhus
will quickly cure. The homeopathist advises it for these in the second decimal
dilution, five drops every two hours.

In any skin disease where there is violent itching, circumscribed redness,
burning, swelling, pain and vesication, especially if fever be present, the condition more or less acute as above mentioned in erysipelas or other skin disorders,
this remedy is prescribed with success.

‘

SYNTHETIC DEPRESSANTS.

In my first editions I gave a conspicuous place to the use of coal tar derivitives as remedies that control fevers. During the fifteen years that followed,
these remedies did not gain ground in the opinion of the profession., Acetanilide
and phenacetin perhaps held their own. “Antipyrine was largely dropped except
for pain. Exalgin is used in but very few conditions. I therefore have not in
this rewriting given them separate space.

Antipyrine in its physiological action is similar to that of phenacetin, but
more pronounced. All the four remedies herein included, produce pallor: first
by impeding the circulation through depression, and secondly after protracted
use, by destroying the red corpuscles and introducing a new toxin—methemoglobin. Cyanosis will follow large doses with all. There is langour,
trembling, and with antipyrine especially, profuse sweating, fall of temperature, impeded respiration, increased feebleness, and rapidity of the pulse,
coma, and difficult breathing with full extreme doses with profound collapse.

Antipyrine relieves pain to a larger extent than the others, but the almost
invariable depression caused, prevents its general use. If it were not for this
it would be a valuable therapeutic remedy. It reduces temperature, and controls
nervous excitability.

Acetanilide is a safer remedy especially when combined with a sodium
salt and caffeine. Its use is reduced to its control of headaches, but so many
unpleasant results have occurred that it is under the ban. Its continued use is
not advised because of its action named above on the red corpuscles. Fewer
accidents occur with this remedy than with antipyrine. Five grain doses are
within safe bounds, though this dose has produced alarming symptoms. None
of these remedies should be used except in sthenic cases, and then repeated but
few times.

Of all four, probably Phenacetin is the safest. It regulates sthenic fevers
to a certain extent, relieves pain, and distress, unlocks secretions, produces a
moist tongue, soft skin and full pulse. Cyanosis does not as readily follow it,
as the others. These remedies are all erratic in their action. They are not like
the organic agents; these exercise a steady, uniform, smooth, regular, permanent influence, acting in perfect harmony with the natural forces in whatever
they do, especially in overcoming fevers. There is no perceptible reaction
after their action, while after these synthetic remedies the temperature recurs
in many cases higher than before.

Exalgin never has held a high place except for some form of pain. For
some special purposes it is relied upon. It is now no longer used as an antipyretic. I at one time cured a number of cases of chorea with this remedy, that
would not readily respond to our other methods. At first I thought it would be
an addition to our list, but later when I came to treat the feebleness, anemia and

SEDATIVES USED IN THE CONTROL OF FEVERS 95

irregularity of the heart, I found in many cases, when only two grains, three
times a day, was given, I discontinued it entirely. I am confident that a thorough
knowledge of the organic remedies will produce in every way a more satisfactory
class of remedies than can be secured from the use of these erratic chemical
products.

COMPARATIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY OF ANTIPYRETICS.

Gelsemium—Fever with nervous phenomena—nervous excitability, restlessness, flushed face, bright eyes, contracted pupils, sharp, quick pulse, nervous twitchings, evidences of acute determination of blood to the brain.

Aconite—Sthenic fever with sharp, hard, quick pulse, dry hot or burning skin, chilliness up and down the spinal column, suppressed secretions; at
the onset of acute fevers; in the early stages of acute inflammations; in the
developing stages of the exanthematous fevers.

Veratrum—Sthenic fever with large, full, bounding, fast pulse, with high
temperature, engorged capilliary circulation; at the onset of acute local inflammation, in previously strong patients; in acute convulsions with high temperature and rapid pulse.

Bryonia—In the fever of acute inflammation; if in the lungs or bronchi
there is sharp, hard, short, quick cough, inducing pain and soreness, quick
pulse; if in serous membranes there are quick acute pains, diffused soreness
and tendency to effusion. Acute synovitis, with pain on movement and threatened exudation, is relieved by it.

Rhus Toxicodendron—<Acute inflammatory fever with sharp, hard pulse;
involvement of the skin, bright, circumscribed redness, with burning pain
and extreme soreness; fever with sharp supra-orbital pain, burning in the
eyes, flushed face, red mucous membranes, dry tongue with reddened tip and
edges, red, narrow, elongated tongue with brown coat; sordes.

Many careful prescribers use antipyrin or acetanilide or phenacetin in
the sthenic stage of violent acute fevers, or inflammations, and if care be exercised in their administration, and the patient closely watched for the first
appearance of their depressing action, good results can be secured occasionally
in adults, especially in strong men. The entire train of symptoms can be
sometimes abated. There is but little distinction to be made in their symptomatology. If given with the first symptoms of acute influenza—la grippe—
their action is usually salutary.

Phosphate of Iron—lIt is impossible to deny the marked benefit that will
occur in very many cases of fevers, especially in the early stages of high
temperatures where the cause is undetermined, by the use of the Homeopathic third or sixth decimal trituration of the above salt called Ferrum
Phos. I have succeeded with the third. Ten grains of this dissolved in four
ounces of hot water, and given to a child with a temperature of 104 to 106
degrees in teaspoonful doses every ten minutes, retaining the heat, have caused
so many of these high temperatures to suddenly abate for me and a normal
condition to supervene that I would not deny its influence.

After using the indicated remedies in the case without satisfaction, I
have dropped them, and substituted this until the temperature was materially
reduced and have then gone back to the original indicated remedy, with
great satisfaction.

I have no printed authority for the fact that if persisted in, in these doses
until the temperature is at the normal point, there would be a subsequent
subnormal temperature in quite a proportion of these cases, that will be difficult to elevate to normal. I have only observed this in my own practice, and

I avoid it by stopping this agent earlier. No harm comes from this, but it
yeed not be induced.

The results are similar whether used in sthenic or asthenic fevers, but I
have observed more promptness in the former than in the latter form, naturally.

Belladonna—Must be studied with reference to its influence in the developing stage of inflammations. It will be found classed with nerve stimulants.
It is @ most important specific remedy in equalizing the circulation and preventing the local hyperemia essential to all local inflammatory action. It is
especially indicated when there is fever with dullness or tendency to stupor,
with dull eyes and dilated pupils. It works in perfect harmony with aconite
or bryonia. It is not a sedative to the fever, but combats the fever processes.
It is given usually with a direct fever remedy.

Macrotys is a valuable remedy in fevers whenever there is muscular aching, general muscular soreness, or muscular irritability; when the muscles are
sore as if pounded or bruised. The muscular distress contributes to the general distress sometimes more than any one other factor, and must be allayed.
This remedy, a few drops in a four-ounce mixture given with the other fever
medicines, is immediately effectual.

Arnica for the same purposes as the above, ten drops in a four-ounce
mixture, with the other remedies, accomplishes the same results for which
macrotys is prescribed. In some cases, these two remedies can be combined
sofa advantage. The above mixtures are given in teaspoonful doses every

our.

ASTHENIC OR ADYNAMIC FEVERS.

It will be observed in the study of the above remedies as applicable to the
reduction of fevers, that with the exception of one or two they are to be prescribed only in sthenic fever—in which there is an apparent temporary
exaltation of vital foree—in which the inherent dynamic influences have unwarranted exercise. Where temporarily, the nervous and vital powers have reacted above or beyond physiological limits, the agents are prescribed to exercise a restraining or inhibiting influence upon the fever, by a sedative or depressing influence upon the nervous system or upon the heart and circulatory
apparatus. They depress vital force.

In many cases fever exists where the vital forces are already depressed or
exhausted to a greater or less extent, and where there is extreme feebleness. In
such a case depressants of vital force are contra-indicated.

In these asthenic or adynamic conditions, it is necessary that the fever be
controlled as in sthenic cases, but a class of remedies must be used which stimulate, encourage or increase the vital forces, in direct opposition to the action of
those advised in sthenic cases.

The conditions in which adynamia with exalted temperature is apt to prevail, are in the later stages of typhus and typhoid fevers, in protracted fevers
of any kind where there has been a great draft upon the vital forces, in the
progress of severe inflammation which has resulted in the breaking down of
structure and the deposit of inflammatory products, and in tubercular or other
eachexia.

While the vital forces must be nourished, supported and encouraged toward
ultimate restoration, measures must be used also, which will restrain the temperature, if possible, at the same time. We have a limited number of remedies that
act specifically for this purpose, and they cannot be placed in a distinct class.
This influence of these agents will be found fully considered in the class in which
the agent is placed because of a wider influence. They will be found classed
usually as nerve or heart stimulants.

SEDATIVES USED IN THE CONTROL OF PAIN 97

Bryonia and Rhus of the previous class have a most important place in
these fevers, as has been specified. One of the best, if not, the best of the remedies
for this purpose is Cactus, which will be found among the specified heart tonics.
Digitalis is excellent for this purpose, although while it sustains the heart
through the progress of the fever, it does not, to so great an extent as cactus,
cause a reduction of the temperature or improve the general nerve tone and add
to the nutrition of the heart. Strophanthus acts much the same as digitalis.

onium is said to possess this power, but it has not yet been widely used.
Other agents will be mentioned as we progress.

One of the safest measures is the abstraction of heat by the use of water.
Much care must be exercised that the water be not too cold. The temperature of
the water is lowered in proportion as the vital force is able to react under it. In
feeble cases, sponging with water at temperature from 100 to 110 degrees is
most satisfactory.

Judicious nutrition and perfect elimination are essential considerations in
the treatment of adynamic fevers.

Note—The study of this first chapter of remedies has proven the statement previously made, that it is impossible as yet to arbitrarily classify our
agents. It will be seen that, while these agents are used in the control of fevers,
and as nerve sedatives, they are also antispasmodics to a marked degree in
some cases, hypnotics, analgesics, diaphoretics, diuretics or alteratives. In
each of the following classes the same fact will be found true. We have endeavored to classify the remedies as they are most commonly used, but each
must be studied without regard to class, in the entire field of its action, especially as indicated by its specific symptomatology.

MORPHINE.

A white or colorless crystalline body in shining prismatic crystals; soluble
in thirty-six parts of hot alcohol, and in alkalies; almost insoluble in water. But
little used in medicine.

Dose, from one-eighth to one-fourth of a grain.

The following salts of morphine are in common use:

Morphine Acetate.

A yellowish-white crystalline body, or an amorphous powder, bitter, inodorous except a slight odor of the acetic acid; soluble in two and one-half parts of
water. Dose, from one-twentieth to one-half of a grain.

Morphine Sulphate.

In white feathery, silky crystals, without odor; of an intensely bitter taste;
soluble in twenty-one parts of water and in seven hundred parts of alcohol.
Dose, one-tenth to one-fourth of a grain.

Morphine Hydrochlorate.

Muriate of Morphine occurs in white needle-shaped, feathery, lustrous crystals; bitter and odorless; soluble in twenty-four parts of water and in sixty-two
parts of alcohol. Dose, from one-twentieth to one-half of a grain.

Apomorphine Hydrochlorate.

This is the product of the action of hydrochloric acid on a modified form of
the alkaloid morphine. It may also be obtained from codeine. It occurs as white
or grayish white crystals, without odor, bitter, turning slightly green upon exposure to the air; soluble in forty-five parts of either water or of alcohol. If
it produces an emerald-green tint in solution in water it must be rejected. It may
become changed in character and dangerous. Solutions must be freshly made.

Apomorphine was first used only as an emetic; usually hypodermically.
The dose for this purpose is from one-twentieth to one-sixteenth of a grain,
although one-eighth of a grain may be given. It is not safe in any dose with
children. It may be given to eject bodies from the esophagus, to evacuate the
eta after the injection of poisons, and in extreme asthmatic or catarrhal
attacks.

A field of action has developed for this remedy, outside of its influence as
an emetic, which is important. There is a consensus of opinion among careful
observers as to this influence. One writer says that in wild delirium, sleep may
be induced with this remedy, and a restful quiet. It should be given in doses
of from one one-hundredth to one-thirtieth of a grain, hypodermically injected.
The dose is less than the emetic dose, and yet sufficient to produce a physiological
effect. It is not given until after the patient is undressed and in bed ready to go
to sleep.

Where it is used for its hypnotic effect alone, ari the patient has not previously taken it, it might be well to begin with a dose as small as the one onehundredth of a grain. In sthenic cases, with much delirium, a little nausea
need not be avoided. The influence of the agent is not protracted, and in some
cases it must be repeated in two or three hours. In others it produces a restfulness, which results in sleep, independent of further action of the remedy.

In hysterical attacks, the agent is valuable, as it produces general quiet,
and refreshing sleep. It may be used in the place of morphine and opium with
those who are addicted to a habit for these drugs, and it will produce the same

SEDATIVES USED IN THE CONTROL OF PAIN 99

results. The drug is a treacherous one, and consequently dangerous, and must
therefore be given with care.

In very minute doses, it is given in bronchitis, where there is a deficiency
of secretion, or in croup, producing relaxation and expectoration. It is given
as an expectorant in cough mixtures, with good results, but its emetic influence
should not be induced. One one-hundredth of a grain, repeated every two
hours, will be sufficiently large dosage. It produces a watery secretion of
mucus, which is often undesirable.

It should be used only with adults, as stated, as children are too susceptible
to its influence. Kinnett has used it in pain from spasms of the pyloris, and
others mention its influence for spasmodic pain in severe, acute stomach disorder in sthenic cases.

Dr. Dice believes apomorphine given in small doses frequently repeated in
the initial stage of appendicitis will prevent the development of many cases of
this disease. He dissolves also a dram of sulphate magnesium in four ounces of
water and gives a teaspoonful every two hours with it.

Apomorphine in doses of one-thirtieth of a grain or less, frequently repeated
controls some very severe cases of vomiting.

In the treatment of alcoholism, this agent is given in sufficient quantity to
produce mild nausea; then one-thirtieth of a grain of strychnine or other indieated stimulant is given for its influence upon the nervous system at the same
time.

CODEINE.

Occurrence—An alkaloid of opium closely related to morphine, often, if
not carefully prepared, containing a certain proportion of morphine.

Character—White octahedral crystals, bitter, odorless, permanent, soluble in eighty parts of water and in three parts of alcohol. The dose of codeine
is from one-fourth to two grains.

Physiological Action—Its influence is that of an anodyne and antispasmodic, more active as an antispasmodic than morphine and much less narcotic.
It controls pain without checking secretion to as great an extent as the other
alkaloids of opium.

Therapy—It has a more marked influence upon pain in the abdomen and
in the pelvic organs. Spasms, neuralgia and other painful conditions in these
parts are well controlled by codeine. Cramp colic and spasmodic dysmenorrhea yield readily to its influence. It is advised in diabetes mellitus to control the excretion of sugar. It has been given in doses of fifteen or twenty grains
daily for this purpose, in some cases with permanent results.

Codeine has a marked influence upon spasmodic cough. It is often given
to soothe irritable conditions of the air passages and to control persistent annoying and exhausting cough.

Physiological Action of Opium and Morphine.

The action of opium, and of morphine and its narcotic salts, is much the
same. Opium is stimulant and narcotic, according to the dose and susceptibility
of the patient. Infants and old people are easily poisoned by the drug, while
those addicted to alcohol can take very large doses without any bad effects; and
those accustomed to the drug can take a poisonous dose with impunity.

In the healthy adult a moderate dose of opium stimulates all the nervous
functions of the body, raises the spirits and excites intellectual action; this gives
way to a condition of placidity, freedom from care, and a state of quiet enjoyment. In an hour or less, consciousness is lost in sleep, which may continue for
eight hours or longer. On waking there is evidence of disturbance of the func-

tions of the organism, such as nausea, vomiting, headache, constipation and
diminished secretion, except that of the skin.

In a dose sufficient to cause death the period of excitement is short, while
the strength of the system rapidly gives way to drowsiness and apoplectic sleep.
There is stertorous breathing, dusky countenance, slow pulse, nearly total insensibility, only responding slightly to violent agitation, with confusion of the mind,
and an inclination to continue in a comatose state with increasing debility.
After a few hours, six to twelve, according to the dose and the resisting power
of the patient, the face becomes pale, the pulse from being full and strong
becomes weak and thready, with cold extremities, a cool and clammy skin, a
slow gasping respiration; a condition from which it is impossible to rouse the
patient and death soon follows.

The pulse is first slow from stimulation of the vasomotor nerve centers, and
becomes rapid as these become paralyzed. The pupil is first contracted by stimulation of the oculo-motor nerves, and dilates as death approaches and these
become paralyzed. Death results from paralysis of respiration.

With some individuals there appears to be an inherent and usually permanent idiosyncrasy against the action of opium and morphine. An exceedingly
minute dose with such, will produce unpleasant symptoms. These are nausea
or violent vomiting, spasm of the stomach and loss of appetite, obstinate constipation or abdominal pain. In others there is nervous excitement, restlessness,
headache, tremors, general distress and an increase of pain. With others it
produces extreme wakefulness instead of restful sleep. In some there is diarrhea instead of constipation. Given under the conditions we have named as
contra-indications, it will often produce these phenomena; where there is an
absence of idiosyncrasy, and where given under the proper conditions, the effects
would be desirable.

Itching of the skin, inducing an apparent miliary eruption, is one of the
unpleasant effects of its use, which, like any one of the others, may be always
greatly exaggerated in certain individuals.

By using water as a solvent, or combining opium with ipecac or camphor, or
in some cases with the bromides, these unpleasant effects can, in great measure,
be overcome.

Its application to open wounds in childhood has produced marked narcotic
effects. It has poisoned infants while nursing, the mother either taking it as
medicine or habitually.

Caution—All of the effects of these agents are especially marked in infants and early childhood. The nervous system is profoundly impressed by them,
and the dose, if given at all to very young babes, should be infinitesimal.

Its administration can be avoided in nearly all cases with these little
patients, as we have access to many agents which, while not working actively
in adults, produce most satisfactorily soothing, anodyne or pain-relieving properties in childhood.

Opium addiction is acquired by continued use of the agent, and is debasing and deadly in its effects.

Another serious objection to its administration in large doses often is that
it conceals or obscures the actual condition, the diagnostic symptoms or the
specific disease indications, and permits disease to advance to formidable proportions before its real character is known. This is true of appendicitis and
other purulent inflammatory conditions.

This agent is so convenient and produces such immediate effects that it is
often used by the indolent, careless physician, when other agents would produce
better after results, and would more speedily promote a permanent cure. It is,
therefore, proper to caution the young physician against depending upon it to
too great an extent, and to urge him to study well all other agents acting syner-

SEDATIVES USED IN THE CONTROL OF PAIN 101

gistically, so that when his knowledge of the other agents permits him to
choose between them he will prefer them. He may thus be able to select an
agent with a single direct influence, where, with the administration of this, he
has undesirable side influences to overcome in addition to the treatment of
the other conditions.

Administration—Opium may be administered by the mouth, by the rectum or vagina, by the hypodermic injection of its alkaloids, by application to a
portion of the surface of the body after removal of the cuticle, by inhalation or
by insufflation.

Where there is a temporarily apparent contra-indication for its use, the
aqueous extract or the deodorized tincture (aqueous) or other aqueous preparations, may be used, as water does not dissolve the narcotine, which is believed to
be the irritating and depressing principle of the alkaloids.

Or it may be given in conjunction with some agent which will overcome
the antagonizing conditions. The acidity of the stomach may be neutralized by
an agreeable alkaline aperient. The inactive secretions may be partially reestablished by pilocarpine or jaborandi, or the bromides may be given in conjunetion to soothe the nervous system, or ergot to unload the brain of an excess
of blood.

The hypodermic use of morphine is demanded and is justifiable where great
pain is present. In these cases the size of the dose must be determined by the
circumstances. Its influence is prompt and satisfactory.

This method is preferable because the chemical influences of the gastric
secretions upon the salt are avuided.

Veterinarians find it necessary to always administer morphine in this manner, as often no desirable effects are produced if brought in contact with the
stomach and intestinal secretions.

Specific Symptomatology—When opium is given carelessly or promiscuously, unfavorable results may occur. The conditions under which the administration of opium or its narcotic salts are admissible are as follows: There is
pain without cerebral engorgement; there is an absence of flushed face, but not
pallor; there is a relaxed, cool and perhaps moist skin; the tongue is moist and
the pupils are not contracted.

Extreme wakefulness or restlessness, painful, spasmodic conditions, excessive passive discharges of whatever character and local inflammations with
the above conditions all indicate the use of the agent.

Pain is the great and primary indication for opium. The agent can often
be substituted in mild cases, and with children, and the causes of pain can
often be removed by other agents; but severe, persistent, racking pain has no
other antidote except anesthesia.

Contra-Indications—In its primary influence it is a brain and nerve stimulant. It is, therefore, contra-indicated where there is an irritated and overstimulated nervous,system, with flushed face, bright eyes with contracted
pupils, dry, hot skin, dry, coated tongue and inactivity of the excretory functions. Administered under these circumstances, it will increase the restlessness and induce general distress and painful wakefulness.

Therapy—In sudden acute pain, in pain from wounds or injury, or from
burns, the contra-indications are seldom present, and morphine can be administered usually hypodermically.

Pain, like a persistent high temperature, will in time produce serious
impressions upon the system which, in themselves, will be hard to overcome.
When pain is not extreme equally good results, however, can be obtained in
many cases from smaller doses of this agent, as from larger ones, with much
less impression upon excretion.

102 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

In the successful and highly satisfactory treatment of peritonitis, appendicitis, pleuritis, ovaritis or metritis, this author early adopted the uniform method of giving the indicated remedies as indicated, and for general
or local soreness or tenderness increased on pressure or on movement of the
bed or clothes, he frequently gives from two to five drops of the deodorized
tincture of opium every two hours; seldom more. This acts in harmony with
bryonia, which is specifically indicated, especially if there be occasional quick,
sharp, darting or shooting pains, with the soreness. Heat may be applied.
In from six to twelve hours the distress is relieved, and in twenty-four hours
the patient is in every way improved. This is accomplished without producing dullness, drowsiness or undue sleep, or without locking up the secretions
and excretions, in fact, without exhibiting but few if any of the physiological
influences of the remedy.

Where distress or wakefulness is present, and of such a character that
morphia is directly indicated, a small dose often repeated in the stomach will
sometimes do better than large doses. In these cases, if half a grain be dissolved in two ounces of water, and a teaspoonful be given every fifteen minutes, the patient will soon become soothed and quiet and will sleep naturally
without knowing what has induced it; a much smaller quantity than is usually
given, being found necessary. In gastric hyperacidity add a grain or two
of sodium bicarbonate. to each dose.

It reduces congestion and engorgement of serous membranes most rapidly,
and is thus specific in the above-named inflammatory conditions, when small,
sharp, stabbing pains and diffused tenderness are the leading symptoms.

It has an especial action on mucous surfaces. Its influence tends to reduce excessive activity or hyper-secretion. It is for this latter effect that
it is useful in catarrhs of all characters, in diarrhoeas and excessive activity
of all secreting organs. D

It controls irritation of the peripheral nerves in the intestinal canal, and
thus arrests diarrhea and controls undue peristaltic action, which in these
cases is often necessary. In surgical diseases of the intestinal canal and after
operations this effect is quickly and essentially obtained.

Opium is a desirable diaphoretic. It promotes excretion from the skin
to a marked degree, exercising this function often, while it locks up the intestinal and renal secretions. It is often given in combination with a relaxant or an emetic for this purpose, and is officinal in combination with camphor
and ipecac, as Dover’s powder. It is or it may be combined with powdered
asclepias tuberosa with happy results.

It is common practice to use opium or morphia in solution for eye washes
—collyria. It is serviceable in many cases.

Opium and its alkaloids are powerful antispasmodics, and are of general
use in local spasm and in convulsion. Specifically, it is useful in colic from
biliary or renal calculi, in uterine and ovarian colic and in the pains of labor,
properly adapted; also in lumbago, sciatica, angina pectoris, gastrodynia,
pleurodynia and other forms of neuralgia.

puerperal convulsions morphine, hypodermically, was by some considered a most superior agent, although those familiar with veratrum prefer
the latter. The dose must be large and must be repeated if needed. It is
now seldom relied upon in this serious condition. It locks the secretions preventing elimination, obscures actual conditions and encourages stasis.

Many physicians use opium to control passive hemorrhage, hemorrhages
from the kidneys and womb, from the lungs and bronchi, and from the
stomach, and from the bowels in typhoid.

It may, however, usually be dispensed with in these cases, as it is not

desirable to lock up the natural secretions of these organs, a common result
from the use of this agent.

It was advised by Pavy as an important agent in the treatment of diabetes, to control all unpleasant conditions, especially the elimination of sugar
and the extreme thirst. Its influence is not permanent, and it does not cure.

It is used also in spermatorrheea, and will temporarily reduce sexual erethrysm and unload the organs of blood and restrain abnormal losses and discharges, but it is not usually curative and cannot be persisted in without
injury.

For gonorrheal injections and as bladder washes and in leucorrhea, it
is incorporated in -liniments and is used as a cataphor.

In the form also of suppositoria, introduced into the rectum or vagina, it
is useful for painful conditions in the rectum and lower bowel, and in painful
pelvic disorders.

It is also applicable in this manner to painful kidney and certain bladder
troubles, in stone and gravel, and in obstinate vomiting.

Immediate relief from the tenesmus of dysentery is accomplished by
the injection of a few drops of a liquid extract of opium in two ounces of
a solution of starch, following the bowel movement.

In China, India, Persia and Turkey, in Mohammedan and Hindoo countries, where their religion prohibits the use of alcoholic intoxicants, opium
was at one time smoked more generally than our own people use tobacco and
alcohol. Its effects are fearful. To this may doubtless be ascribed much of
the intellectual inactivity, the moral debasement and the lack of advancement of the civilization of these countries.

Toxicity—Opium has been used as much if not more than any other agent
for suicidal or homicidal purposes. It is certainly a desirable agent for suicide if one desires a comfortable and painless death. It is also acceptable
when euthanasia is desired.

Antidotes—It is antidoted by extreme heat, physical activity, increased
nerve action and stimulation. Active mechanical emetics or the stomach pump
should be used to evacuate the stomach. These are mustard in warm water,
ipecac, lobelia in single full doses, or sulphate of zinc.

The direct antagonists are atropia in small doses hypodermically in the
early stages of its toxication,’ strong coffee, or caffeine hypodermically in
large doses—two to five grains, strychnine hypodermically and nitro-glycerine, alcohol, ammonium and digitalis. Potassium permanganate will neutralize the poisonous properties of morphine. The patient is kept moving with
flagellation and electricity and in extreme cases artificial respiration.

HEROIN. HEROIN HYDROCHLORIDE.

Synonyms—Diacetylmorphine Hydrochloride.

This is one of the recent derivatives of opium which has come into use.
because of its soothing influence over the respiration and the respiratory
apparatus.

This is a bitter, odorless powder, composed of minute white crystals. Unlike
morphine, it does not stupefy the patient nor induce constipation. It is classed
among the opium preparations, and is therefore included in the Harrison Act,
as one of the habit-forming drugs.

The agent is given in doses of from one twenty-fifth to one-sixth of a grain.
Small doses frequently repeated will produce the best results..

It is without doubt a powerful depressant to the nervous system and especially to the respiratory center. One of my patients, of his own accord, purchased a bottle of a mixture of heroin for a cough, and took it so frequently
that a temporary but severe mania was induced, for which he was taken to a
detention hospital, and received injuries from which he died. It is thought to be
of some benefit in the treatment of certain coughs. It is an ingredient of several
proprietary cough remedies.

CONIUM. CONIUM MACULATUM.

Synonyms—Poison Hemlock; Poison Parsley.

ConstTITUENTS—A volatile alkaloid Conine, Conhydrine, Methylcenine,
Pseudo-Conhydrine.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Conii, Extract of Conium. Dose, one-half grain.

_Extractum Conii Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Conium. Dose, two to six

_Expressed juice of the fresh plant preserved with alcohol. Dose, three

ms.

Specific Conium. Dose, one to five minims.

There is great variation in the quality of the different preparations of
conium, and care must be exercised in selecting a good one.

Physiological Action—When given in a sufficient dose, conium causes complete relaxation of the whole muscular system; the eyes close, the movements
of the eyeballs are sluggish, mastication and swallowing are difficult, speech is
slow and maintained by an effort, the voice is hoarse, while the heart and intelligence are not disturbed. In a fatal dose, the lower limbs become paralyzed, the
effect gradually ascending to the upper part of the body, intelligence being
retained to the last.

Administration—If the characteristic odor of this substance is absent,
the probabilities are that it is devoid of value, as it is the volatile principle
which possesses the odor, and it is that upon which its value as a therapeutic
agent depends to a great extent. Care must be taken in diluting fluid preparations as they are apt to precipitate. Fresh preparations only, diluted when
administered, are reliable.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent relieves the pain of cancers and
ulcers. In this it is of specific value. It is of much importance in ulceration
of the stomach either acute or chronic, and in incipient gastric cancer. It will
soothe the pain more efficiently than other apparently more powerful agents.
It must be given in large doses; as much as fifteen minims of the fluid extract are
sometimes needed. Large doses must be carefully watched. It relieves distress
in the glandular organs and in glandular enlargements, when there is a scrofulous or cancerous cachexia, dull aching pains not usually acute, not sharp cutting

pains. In the pain of cancer of the pelvic organs or of the mamme it gives relief,
and, indeed, it gives relief to pain in the pelvic organs whatever the cause or
character.

Therapy—The anodyne and antispasmodic soothing properties of the agent
suggest its use in spasmodic affections and irregular muscular movements—
movements attended by extreme activity of the motor nerves. In paralysis agitans, in chorea and in hysteria, in delirium tremens and acute mania it is thus
advised. Its use in trismus, laryngeal spasm, in irregular muscular twitehings
and spasmodic wry neck, will be attended with excellent results. In profound spasm, as in convulsions, epilepsy and tetanus, while of some benefit,
it is of no marked value and more potent agents are prescribed. In its ad-

ministration, hypodermic injections of Hydrobromate of Conine are sometimes
much more prompt and satisfactory in their action.

Conium is useful in many kinds of cough and inflammatory diseases of
the chest. In whooping cough and in many other spasmodic coughs it is of
much service. It is useful in asthma and the difficult breathing of emphysema.
It may be used internally or the ointment may be applied over the chest.

It is valuable in laryngitis and in dry irritable bronchial coughs and in
phthisis. In all such coughs the vapors inhaled from the fluid extract or juice
dropped on the surface of hot water, in a rather close-mouthed vessel, is sometimes of marked benefit. In the pains of chronic hepatitis conium is excellent.

As an application to cancerous surfaces, poultices prepared from the leaves
have given relief, and ointments carefully prepared which contain the juice
or small quantities of conine, will be found of service. Lotions containing the
juice or fluid extract will be found of use in open sores and persistent ulcerations.

In ovarian pain or pain from ulceration of the cervix uteri, or other persistent uterine pain or distress, a vaginal suppository containing a grain of
conium may be inserted at night, or twice daily, if the patient be recumbent.
Rectal and painful ulcers may be treated with rectal suppositories.
Pain from acute pelvic inflammation may be relieved by this method.

CANNABIS. CANNABIS INDICA.

Synonyms—Cannabis Sativa, Indian Hemp.

ConstTITUENTs—Cannabin, Cannabinine, Volatile Oil, Gum, Sugar, Potassium Nitrate.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Cannabis Indice, Extract of Cannabis Indica.
Dose, one-sixth to one grain.

Extractum Cannabis Indice Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Cannabis Indica.
Dose, one to five minims.

Specific Medicine Cannabis. Dose, one to ten minims.

The strength of preparations varies, and some may be inert. If the
precipitate formed when the drug is added to water be olive-green, it is active;
but its strength should always be tested by tentative doses.

Physiological Action—Cannabis indica is narcotic. Bartholow classed it
as a cerebral excitant. In some persons the drug causes excitement tending to
acts of violence and crime; in others it excites merriment, or a maudlin state.
In general it produces hallucination, perverts the natural perception of objects,
intensifies the perception of sound, dilates the pupils, abolishes pain, and, in
poisonous doses, causes spasms, convulsions, collapse, pale, clammy, insensible
skin, extreme debility, feeble pulse, and finally paralysis of respiration. The
habitual use of the drug causes bloating of the face, weak, tremulous limbs,
injected eyes, imbecility, and ultimately death from marasmus.

Those who use cannabis regularly, believe that in medicinal doses it is not
poisonous. It can be safely given in full doses, the tincture in from ten to
twenty minims, and the solid extract in from one-half to two grains. It seems
to be a true sedative to the stomach with few undesirable influences. Its best
effects are secured when given in conjunction with alkalies in full doses or
with mild aperients.

Therapy—Cannabis Indica is sedative, narcotic, anodyne and, to a limited
degree, anti-spasmodic. It acts upon disturbed function of the nervous system.

It is a remedy for disordered mental action.

It is a remedy for disorders of motility, involuntary, irregular, muscular
movements, especially if of a distressing character.

It is a remedy to arrest or control pain, often acting advantageously in
conjunction with other pain-quieting agents, intensifying, modifying or favorably influencing their action.

It is a remedy for excitable and irritable hyperesthetic conditions of the
genito-urinary organs, with increased functional activity and uterine disorders.

In many forms of urinary irritation, its action is prompt and satisfactory
especially, Quincey says, where there are only a few drops passed frequently,
constant unsatisfied desire, burning pain and vesical tenesmus.

In the wakefulness of old age, in the restlessness of nervous exhaustion,
and in melancholia, it is an important remedy. It is useful in the treatment of
neuralgia and hemicrania. It takes high rank in affections of the brain and
nerves of the head, especially if nervous vertigo be present, and in those attacks
of hemicrania which occur periodically, very distressing, causing delirium and
much prostration. It is especially applicable in sub-acute inflammation of the

rain, in delirium tremens and in the hypochondria of the menopause.

This remedy has received a great deal of attention in its adaptability to
cerebro-spinal meningitis, and with varying but encouraging results, especially
in the earlier stages of irritation and congestion. It is useful also in hydrophobia, and in large doses it is sometimes palliative to the distressing symptoms. Minute doses will cure some cases of tinnitus aurium.

It is useful in the distress of Potts’ disease and hip joint disease and in
general rickets. In epilepsy, either alone or combined with the bromides, it has
been given very extensively for several years.

Dr. Cook of Seattle suffered from nervous breakdown with extreme exhaustion; tremor on awakening in the morning, with active functional heart
disturbance. He took five drops of specific cannabis three times a day on the
tongue, followed by a sip of water. On extreme occasions, he would repeat the
dose once in half an hour. Not only was the whole nervous excitability controlled, but the heart was restored to its normal action and the urinary irritability was overcome.

It is of much use in paralysis agitans, in relief of the lightning pains of
locomotor ataxia, and especially in chorea and in general muscular tremblings.
In chronic conditions accompanied by persistent pain, it ameliorates the pain.

In functional disorder of the stomach accompanied by pain, it is an excellent sedative, and in intestinal disorders it is equally applicable. It does not
suppress secretions or disarrange the functional operations of the organs.

In aching and painful irritation, or in the passage of gravel, it is a most
soothing remedy. It is beneficial here also in painful hematuria, whether from
cancer or tuberculosis, from profound congestion or nephritis.

It is a soothing tonic to the uterine muscular structure, and in inertia and
subinvolution it increases muscular power and energy and promotes contraction. It is useful in menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. It is a valuable sedative
adjuvant to combine with the well known uterine tonics in general disorders
of the pelvic organs amenable to medical treatment not of a surgical character,
especially. if the pains are of neuralgic or spasmodic character. It will allay
abnormal sexual appetite, and will overcome the hysteria and emotional excitement which occur in some women at the menstrual period.

In neuralgic dysmenorrhea it will occasionally cure patients who have
been treated by other methods without results. There are few remedies that
will excel it in this disorder, but the remedy must be given continuously, beginning before the expected paroxysm some little time and continued for a
time after the paroxysm is relieved.

SEDATIVES USED TO INDUCE SLEEP 107

It is an excellent remedy in gonorrhea with sexual hyperesthesia. Hert
its influence is prompt; it arrests chordee, priapism and spermatorrhea. —

It controls violent erection and soothes the mental anxiety which aggravates the symptoms. It cures many irritable states of the bladder. It is curative in strangury and painful urination with burning and scalding. In spasmodic stricture, with gelsemium or macrotys, it relieves quickly. It is a
remedy for functional impotence.

It is soothing to irritable bronchial coughs and laryngeal spasm, and in
coughs from tickling in the throat; also in whooping cough and in spasmodic
coughs of whatever character. It is a common ingredient of cough syrups.

Co-operatives—The agent acts similarly in a general way to opium, gelsemium, passiflora, the bromides, chloral and hyoscyamus.

CHAPTER III.

Sedatives Used to Induce Sleep.

PASSIFLORA. PISCIDIA. SULPHONAL.
HYOSCYAMUS. CHLORAL. VERONAL.
PASSIFLORA. PASSIFLORA INCARNATA.

Synonym—Passion Flower.

PREPARATION—Extractum Passiflore Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Passiflora. Dose, from ten minims to one dram. Specific Passiflora. Dose, from
one to fifteen minims.

Physiological Action—Ott reports a series of experiments to determine the
physiological action of passiflora incarnata. As a result he concludes that the
agent exercises a depressing influence upon the reflex activity of the spinal
cord. In acute mania it arrests the exaggerated activity of the cortex. It
temporarily reduces the pulse and arterial tension, the latter apparently being
due to an action upon the vasomotor center of the medulla oblongata. It stimulates the respiration and can therefore be given in large doses without danger.

Passiflora given in excessive doses causes spasms and paralysis in animals.
It acts as a narcotic and antispasmodic in man when given in moderate doses.
No extended jnvestigation concerning its physiological action has yet been
made.

Broadnax said that it is used by negroes in an application of the bruised
leaves as a poultice to the head, for headaches; also to bruises to relieve pain.
A decoction is used in teaspoon and tablespoonful doses in various aches and
pains. Old rheumatics use poultices made from a strong decoction with cloths
wrung out and bound tightly over the swollen joints. His attention was called
to it by the peculiar odor of a mess of the green bruised leaves, bound to an old
woman’s abdomen. By this he learned of its use and used it for twenty-five
years quite steadily.

It is as yet difficult to explain the fact that in some cases this agent is
prompt, efficient and highly satisfactory, while in others the same preparation
is inactive. This fact has created a wide difference of opinion between observers as to its usefulness.

Specific Symptomatology—Wakefulness, disturbed sleep from mental
worry, and exhaustion from cerebral fulness and from excitement, especially
with feebleness. Anemic patients are relieved by it, also the wakefulness of
infants and the aged. It is not usually efficient if the wakefulness is caused
by pain, nor when the patient is in full strength.

108 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Nervous excitement, and irritation with muscular twitchings—evidences of
approaching convulsions in childhood—with marked cerebral fulness are indications, and it is given at any time preceding or during convulsive paroxysms
if it can be swallowed. It is indicated in convulsions of any character.

Therapy—In the convulsions of childhood it is a most reliable agent. The
writer has given it at the onset of the spasm when the approaching symptoms
were unmistakable, and has had the satisfaction of seeing all the symptoms
disappear so promptly, that confidence has become established. It has controlled severe spasms while the irritating causes yet remained, and after all
antispasmodics except anesthesia have been ineffectual. It can be relied upon
to hold the spasms in check while the causes are being removed, and reduces
their force and character. In epilepsy it lessens the number of the paroxysms,
but to ward off the paroxysms the attack must be anticipated by a full dose
of the remedy. When its approach is unannounced, the full effects of the agent
are not obtained.

Passifilora has hypnotic properties which differ from other agents of this
class in that the sleep produced is normal in all its characteristics. The patient
goes to sleep naturally, can be awakened as usual at any time, to fall into a
quiet, natural slumber. He awakens at the usual time rested and refreshed,
with no disturbance of the cerebral functions, no languor, dulness or other disagreeable sensations. _

Dr. Steele of Missouri uses passiflora in chorea. In persistent cases he
combines it with macrotys with satisfactory results.

If given in doses sufficiently large, it may be relied upon to assist in the
relaxation of the tonic spasm of meningitis, and local tetanic spasm. It has
relieved a few cases of general tetanus. It has cured tetanus in horses. It may
be given as an antidote to the spasms of strychnine poisoning, but it must be
given in doses of from one-fourth to one-half ounce and frequently repeated.
As an anti-spasmodic in cases where there is engorgement of the nerve centers,
it is applicable. It has relieved tonic and clonic spasms, and the spasms of
sthenic as well as asthenic conditions. —

In the treatment of hysteria the agent should be persisted in. It may be
given in conjunction with macrotys, gelsemium and pulsatilla, and if there be
pain, due to menstrual or other disorders, it may be combined with cannabis
indica, or Jamaica dogwood, in appropriate and properly regulated doses.

Dr. Roth believes that passiflora is a direct stomach sedative. A number
of physicians have confirmed this opinion. One patient who had been on a
spree for days suffering from persistent hiccough, took a teaspoonful of the
tincture every hour. This gave him freedom from the hiccough and in a short
time a quiet, natural, continued sleep, waking in the morning in nearly a
normal condition.

Dr. Freeman gives a combination of passiflora four drams, hyoscyamus
one-half dram, cannabis indica one-half dram in a four ounce mixture, an
to patients addicted to drug habits, who cannot sleep, he gives from one to
two teaspoonfuls of this at early bedtime, repeated if necessary.

One of the attending physicians in the tuberculosis wards of Cook County
Hospital told this author that passiflora was his reliance in the sleeplessness of
tuberculosis, especially controlling the cough. He would add two drams of
passifiora to three ounces of water, and give a dram every half hour, the latter
part of the day or early evening and during the night, and very seldom failed
to secure satisfactory results. Other forms of cough can be relieved by it.

The agent is not known to possess injurious or poisonous properties. It
has been used in erysipelas both externally and internally, and in acute inflammatory skin disorders with nervous elements and nervous complications.

SEDATIVES USED TO INDUCE SLEEP 109
HYOSOYAMUS. HYOSOYAMUS NIGER.

Synonym—Henbane.

Constitvents—Hyoscyamine, Hyoscine, Scopolamine, Hyoscipicrin.

PrepaRaTions—Extractum Hyoscyami, Extract of Hyoscyamus. Dose,
from one to two grains. Extractum Hyoscyami Fluidum, Fluid Extract of
Hyoscyamus. Dose, from five to twenty minims. Specific Hyoscyamus. Dose,
from one to ten minims.

Physiological Action—Henbane is a narcotic and causes deranged vision,
headache, giddiness, dilated pupils, dry throat, hoarseness, weakness of the
lower limbs, spasms, cramps, paralysis, loss of speech, or loquacious delirium
with hallucinations, followed by a dreamy sleep, according to the amount
taken. A continuous use of the medicine causes an eruption of the skin of a red
color, which is dry and itching. In some cases large doses cause furious
delirium,

While power to temporarily increase nerve force—mild stimulant properties—is ascribed to hyoscyamus, that influence is much less marked than in
belladonna and stramonium, although its general effects are in many ways
similar to these agents in medicinal doses. It is almost entirely devoid of
irritant properties, but is soothing, calmative and sedative to a marked degree.

Specific Symptomatology—lIt is specific in excitable mental conditions, and
in the violent and noisy delirium of fevers and acute inflammations, to subdue
the excitement and to induce sleep.

In all conditions where there are busy delirium, hallucinations, weight
in the front part of the brain, extreme activity of the mind, disturbed sleep
with wild and frightful dreams, coma vigil, flushed face, wild, red and restless
eyes, it is a sure remedy. In the restlessness, ceaseless agitation and insomnia
of exhaustion, and in diseases of infants and of the extreme aged and feeble, it
is especially applicable.

Therapy—It is valuable in the pneumonitis of infants for its general soothing influence, and for its sedative effect upon the cough and respiration, and
also in bronchitis, with short, sharp cough. A dry cough, increased upon lying
down and relieved upon getting up, is surely relieved by its use.

It does not arrest secretion, and in this particular is in every way superior
to opium. It does not disturb the mind or produce headache.

The anodyne properties of this agent are not marked in its general applieation, but administered in the neuralgia of exhaustion, in this variety of
neuralgic dysmenorrhea and in irritable conditions of the bladder, as well
as in the bone pains of syphilis, it exercises anodyne properties to a remarkable
degree. In hepatic, renal, intestinal, ovarian and uterine pain, accompanied
with great restlessness, it is of much value.

a hypnotic for infants and the aged there is no happier agent than
hyoscyamus, in small doses. From five to ten drops of the fluid extract should
be dropped into half a glassful of water, and a teaspoonful may be given
every fifteen minutes, for two hours before the usual bedtime or until the
patient sleeps. The sleep is quiet, restful, natural and not too sound. The
patient awakens refreshed. It is indicated also in patients enfeebled from prolonged illness.

In headaches attendant upon the above irritable conditions the agent is
applicable.

Since the profession has learned to use hyoscine and morphine together,
for the peculiar analgesic influence of this compound, I am reminded that
during the largest part of my experience I have been in the habit of combining morphine, when that remedy is indicated for pain, with hyoscyamus,
with excellent results.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 97

110 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

It is well known that morphine is acted upon imperfectly, or chemically,
by an extremely acid condition of the stomach. Also that there are certain
nervous constitutions that have unpleasant nervous irritation from its influence (an idiosyncrasy, often). In place of acting as a stimulant, it acts as an
irritant and depressant.

T have learned that the use of hyoscyamus, in the proportion of ten drops
of the specific medicine with one dram or more of strontium bromide, combined with a mild stimulant such as capsicum, and one grain of morphine added
to the whole, has remarkable pain relieving properties out of all proportion to
the small amount of morphine it contains. I add the above to two ounces of
water or other simple menstruum, and give it in teaspoonful doses every ten,
twenty or thirty minutes until the first effects are observed.

The influence of this simple preparation is exceedingly happy, especially
where something soothing is needed for distress, general discomfort, nervous
irritability, or wakefulness. A sensitive stomach after anesthesia for surgical
operations, will retain this in a remarkable manner usually, and the patient
can thus be kept free from pain and discomfort, and will enjoy natural and
restful sleep with only an occasional dose.

The alkaloid Hyoscyamine Sulphate, in doses of one-eightieth of a grain,
works better often than other forms of the agent in paralysis agitans, locomotor ataxia, the tremors of old age, and in tetanus. It is of value in chorea.
In chronic dementia, with destructive tendencies, and sleeplessness, in insanity
with delusions and hallucinations, in epileptic mania, and in fact, in mania of
all forms it is excellent, especially when there are with the above, erratic
tendencies.

Co-Operatives—Gelsemium, stramonium, opium and passiflora incarnata,
facilitate the action of hyoscyamus. The alkaloid duboisia is said to be identical with hyoscyamine. Atropine is also identical in some of its properties.

PISOIDIA. PISCIDIA ERYTHRINA.

Synonym—Jamaica Dogwood.

Constiruents—Piscidin, Resin, Oil, Calcium Oxalate.

PreparaTions—Extractum Piscidie Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Piscidia.
Dose, from a half to two drams.

Physiological Action—In moderate doses, Piscidia lessens sensation, induces sleep and increases the saliva and perspiration. In toxic doses it destroys
sensation, paralyzes the respiratory centers, reduces the heart’s action; first
increases, then diminishes arterial tension and decreases the pulse rate. It
first contracts, then dilates the pupils in full overdoses. It causes dyspnea,
spinal convulsions, general paralysis and death. It reduces reflex action, including tetanic spasm, by excessive stimulation of the spinal cord.

Felter and Lloyd quote Dr. Ott as giving the following concerning the
physiological action of this remedy: It increases the salivary and cutaneous
secretions, slows the pulse, increases the arterial tension, its action being succeeded by reduced tension, which is due to a weakening of the heart. It dilates
the pupils, except when the patient is passing into a state of asphyxia, when
contraction takes place. It does not affect the irritability of the motor nerves,
nor the peripheral sensory nerve ending. It may cause heart failure or arrest
of respiratory action. In some susceptible patients small doses produce nausea,
vomiting and headache.

Dr. Harris of New York says the remedy increases dyspnea, which is followed, from sufficient doses, by respiratory paralysis.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 98

SEDATIVES USED TO INDUCE SLEEP 111

There is drowsiness, gradually increasing; muscular relaxation; inco-ordination of movement; diminished reflexes; lowered sensibility; dilatation of the
pupils. Toxic doses produce convulsions and a tetanoid condition caused by
overstimulation of the spinal cord.

Piscidia stimulates salivary secretion, diaphoresis, and to a slight extent
diuresis.

It logically follows that its usefulness depends upon its action upon the
brain and spinal cord, for other remedies excel it in its effect: upon the heart,
lungs and glands. Furthermore, it is well to consider that this remedy has no
direct effect upon the gastro-intestinal tract, and that it therefore induces no
nausea, no anorexia; that it does not suppress the secretions; that it does not
inhibit normal peristalsis; causes no unpleasant after-effects and produces no
subsequent craving for drug. It may therefore truly be called a harmless
nerve sedative, indicated in the three following conditions: (1) spasmodic affections; (2) neuralgic affections; (3) cerebral excitation.

Administration—The agent must be given in sufficient doses and repeated.
It is not active in small doses. It lacks the power of opium, but operates in the
same lines as an analgesic, with desirable exceptions.

It is especially applicable in those cases where the patient cannot take
opium or morphine. It does not produce toxic or undesirable effects in medicinal doses.

Specific Symptomatology—tThe agent, in doses of from a half drachm to a
drachm, will produce quiet and restful sleep, when the insomnia is due to
nervous excitement, mental worry or anxiety, and in elderly patients, neurasthenics and children.

Therapy—In susceptible patients it will control pain and relieve general
distress. It is distinctly a nerve sedative, and overcomes nervous excitability
and also reflex irritability. It is an antispasmodic of much power in mild cases.

If given during the course of inflammatory fever of any character, and in
inflammatory rheumatism, it is a useful and grateful remedy. It does not
oppose other indicated agents, and induces the often needed sleep.

In violent spasmodic cough it produces relief, and in the irritating persistent cough of bronchitis it is of service as an auxiliary to cough syrups.
In phthisis it controls the night cough and induces restful sleep.

It has been highly lauded as a specific in whooping cough. The cough of
phthisis will yield to the remedy under consideration when large doses of
codeine have failed. In dysmenorrhea piscidia has been remarkably efficacious. A morphine habitue, taking ten grains three times daily, suffered excruciating agony at menstrual periods. An increase of two grains at each dose
brought no relief. Piscidia, in ten drop doses every hour brought relief, and
hitherto has proved unfailing in that particular case.

Acute intestinal colic yields to piscidia. Gall-stone colic and renal colic,
while not yielding to the remedy as they do to morphine, are rendered bearable
by Jamaica dogwood after an initial dose of the former. It has been used to
lessen labor pains, and has been lauded by some observers as highly efficacious.

Facial neuralgia seems particularly amenable to the action of piscidia.
Ovarian neuralgia and pains due to straining on the uterine ligaments in displacement and tumor, are relieved by this remedy. It seems to have a satisfactory influence on all pelvic pain.

For sleeplessness, in both sthenic and asthenic conditions, piscidia is a
reliable remedy. Delirium in sthenic conditions yields to piscidia as does
hysteria consequent upon uterine and ovarian disorders. Piscidia is of use in
hemicrania and congestive headaches generally.

In obstetrics it controls erratic pains and conduces to quiet and rest, and


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 99

112 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

overcomes rigidity by its specific relaxing or antispasmodic influence, although
it does not interfere with the normal uterine contractions.

In the distress following the adjustment of fractured bones or reduction
of dislocations, it is especially useful and satisfactory.

It is often applied to local painful conditions with benefit. It relieves
toothache, local neuralgias, and the pain of developing felons and boils. In
these cases it exhibits active anodyne properties.

It acts in close harmony with the vegetable uterine remedies, promoting
the influence of macrotys, the viburnums, senecio, helonias, pulsatilla and
dioscprea.

CHLORAL. CHLORAL HYDRATE.

The name Chloral is authorized when Chloral hydrate is intended. If
Chloral proper is intended, the U. S. Dispensatory specifies Anhydrous Chloral.

The influence of Chloral in full therapeutic doses is exercised in the production of sleep. If it be taken on a comparatively empty stomach the patient
becomes quiet in half an hour, and the sleep lasts from two to six hours, according to the previous condition of the mind, whether tranquil or disturbed. It
usually produces a dreamless, natural sleep, followed by few unpleasant symptoms, Occasionally, however, the dose fails, and the second or third dose is
necessary.

At other times it produces cerebral distress or headache, nausea, faintness and extreme lassitude. There is no marked apparent influence upon the
pulse or respiration in normal cases, but the pupil contracts somewhat. During
the period of induced sleep the patient may be awakened to full consciousness,
may take food, may even transact items of business, and then lie down and
almost immediately fall into a continued natural sleep. Cough is not always
allayed by it, and this may awaken the patient, or a desire to urinate may
awaken him.

Chloral has but little influence over pain. It may be given during pain
to induce sleep. If that result is accomplished by sufficient dosage, the patient’s
countenance shows the presence of pain, and he will complain upon waking of
its having continued during his sleep.

Greatly prolonged use of chloral produces impairment of the appetite, bad
taste in the mouth and bad breath, with fetid fecal discharges, deficient secretion of the gastric and biliary fluids, and an increase of the nervous phenomena
for which it is usually prescribed; also an eruption, irritation or ecchymosis
and red rash of the skin with desquamation. It permanently abates both
mental and physical vigor.

Contra-Indications—Chloral is contra-indicated in feebleness with exhaustion, or when there is a tendency to stupor or coma or general dullness, and in
cerebral anemia. It is contra-indicated in weak heart, especially if existing in
alcoholism.

Specific Symptomatology—tThe direct influence of chloral is that of a profound nerve sedative and a producer of quiet, restful and natural sleep. In
its influence over the muscular system it produces profound relaxation similar
to that of gelsemium, but attended in extreme cases, or where the heart is
feeble, with more danger..

Therapy—It is a promoter of quiet and repose in all conditions of nervous
excitability and extreme restlessness. In the excitement and noisy delirium of
fevers no agent acts more satisfactorily. It quiets excitement, overcomes the
delirium if due to cerebral engorgement and induces normal sleep.


<!-- chunk -->

SEDATIVES USED TO INDUCE SLEEP 118

It is a superb remedy in the sleeplessness of inflammatory fevers, and in
the earlier stages of typhoid and other continued fevers, except in the later or
asthenic stages when the vital force is exhausted when it must not be given.

Chloral will induce sleep in chorea, and during the sleep the symptoms will
abate, but it does not cure the difficulty.

Chloral is of much value in hysteria and the nervous phenomena of this
condition. It is best given in conjunction with a stimulant in asthenic cases,
as it possesses no inherent stimulating properties.

It is a reliable remedy in pruritus from nervous causes, especially pruritis
vulve of pregnancy, with nervous erethism which causes increased nervous
phenomena and prevents sleep. One or two doses of fifteen grains will often
control the condition for a day or two.

In puerperal convulsions chloral is a reliable remedy and has been often
used in the past.

In rigid os uteri, with or without general nervous irritation, with hot
vagina and irritable nagging pains, and no advancement of the labor, chloral
is a useful remedy. Fifteen grains repeated if necessary in half an hour will
usually cause an entire change in the condition. It will quickly relax the rigid
os and change the character of the pains. It will quiet the nervous excitement
and secure an interval of restful sleep.

It acts promptly in such a case if a diluted solution of twenty or thirty
grains be injected into the rectum, previously evacuted with a hot enema. It
does not in these doses usually interfere with uterine contractions or subsequent involution.

It is a useful hypnotic in the sleeplessness of the aged, with whom small

doses exercise a satisfactory influence. The influence of chloral upon children,
in small doses of from one to three grains is very soothing. In nervous and
restless children with disturbed sleep, children who toss about during the
entire night or cry out frequently, or awake in terror, this agent has a charming influence. A small dose should be given an hour before bedtime and repeated as the child is put to bed—from one-fourth to three-fourths of a grain
each year of the child’s age. This should be repeated on two or three consecutive nights, if no unpleasant symptoms appear, when the bad habits will be
temporarily broken. On their reappearance it may be resumed again for a
night or two. The cause of the restlessness should be discovered and relieved
also.
Chloral is an excellent remedy in convulsions of children. It is safe in
proper doses and powerfully antispasmodic. In combination with the sodium
or potassium bromides, a solution may be kept at hand for emergencies, and
will prevent approaching spasm and promptly control those existing. It will
allay nervous twitchings and other evidences of nerve irritation, and will
soothe and quiet the patient and induce refreshing sleep. It is not to be given
if the convulsions occur from exhaustion or after prostrating disease.

As we have learned our vegetable anti-spasmodics better, we depend on
these with results so nearly perfect that we seldom think of the inorganic
agents though potent and controllable.

Chloral is useful in whooping cough and in the paroxysm of spasmodic
asthma. It will relieve asthmatic dyspnoea occasionally when dependent upon
nerve irritation..

It is used in epilepsy with advantage. In nocturnal petit mal, if the attack
can be anticipated, a full dose at the bed hour will usually ward it off.

In tetanus chloral has been in quite common use, full doses being necessary. A physician whose name we have now lost, reported several years ago
that he had cured several cases of traumatic tetanus by opening the wound
freely and filling it with finely-powdered chloral to the extent of sixty grains.

114 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

It is a reliable agent in delirium tremens, and in acute mania and in the
paralysis of the insane. It soothes excitability as well as induces sleep.

Theoretically, chloral should prevent the excretion of sugar in the urine in
diabetes mellitus. In practice, a few cases only have been so henefited. It
deserves further investigation in this line.

Chloral is not a remedy for hypodermic injection; it produces local irritation and abscess. It has been advised for use by intravenous injection in the
treatment of tetanus, in puerperal convulsion, strychnia poisoning, and hydrophobia, but such care is demanded in its use that it has not received general
adoption. Further investigations may prove its benefits.

Chloralamide is a derivative of anhydrous chloral. It is given in doses of
five to thirty grains, and is prescribed for the same conditions as chloral. It is
not so depressing on the heart, nor as irritating to the stomach.

SULPHONAL.

Synonym—Diethylsulphonedimethylmethane.

Administration—The dose is from fifteen to thirty-five grains. Its large
dose and insolubility render its administration difficult. It is suspended in
mucilage or syrup, and must be administered several hours before its influence
is desired.

It is best given in hot solution upon a comparatively empty stomach, as it
is only appropriated by decomposition, and not by the rapid absorption of a
free solution. Its influence is so slow that often, when given to produce sleep,
this influence is not exercised until the night has passed, causing the patient to
pass a drowsy, uncomfortable day.

Physiological Action—It is not considered a poisonous agent, and yet much
discomfort arises from its use with some patients. Symptoms of a toxic chars
acter will appear; difficulty of speech, temporary muscular inco-ordination,
fullness of the head and vertigo; in prolonged cases, physical weakness, mental
incapacity, forgetfulness, delusions and mental aberration. It colors the urine
a deep red, as it is eliminated by the kidneys, and sometimes produces a characteristic rash on the skin. Its tastelessness is a redeeming quality, as it can
be given without the knowledge of the patient. It does not irritate the stomach or bowels, neither does it suppress secretions. It does not affect the digestion or destroy the appetite.

Specific Symptomatology—It is a remedy for sleeplessness when the brain
is overcharged and the mind is excited or worried. It is useful in those greatly
worried over physical conditions, such as those suffering from gonorrhea or
spermatorrhea.

Therapy—lIt is decidedly a hypnotic, but is not as reliable or as active as
chloral, and yet it sometimes succeeds where that agent has failed. It is used
in the sleeplessness of alcoholics and in delirium tremens. It has won its reputation largely in this latter condition.

In mania with extreme nervous excitement and general nerve irritation,
and in pronounced insanity, it has been widely used with excellent results.

It is useful in prolonged fevers because of its non-irritating and non-depressing character.

It quiets the restlessness of teething children, soothes the gums like the
bromides, wards off spasms and induces sleep. It is safe, and the little ones
are probably more susceptible to its influence because of increased facility of
appropriation. Its tastelessness is in its favor here also.

SEDATIVES USED ON GENERAL NERVOUS IRRITABILITY 115

VERONAL.

Synonym—Diethylmalonylurea.

The agent is given in capsules of from five to ten grains. It is best given an
hour before its influence is needed, as its action is slow. Long continued use
demands an increased dose as it seems to lose its effect.

The agent is comparable with sulphonal. It is devoid of some of the
objectionable influences of the other drug, and is more prompt in its action. Its
free solubility contributes to this. Insomnia induced by nervous excitability
of any character is relieved by it. Over doses induce protracted sleep in proportion to the amount taken. Two or two and one-half drams will produce
death, though a fatal ending is slow in occurring. Sleep has been prolonged
ten days with recovery.

If combined with sodium, veronal becomes a safer remedy with a somewhat wider influence. It is usually preferred in this form.

Trional and Tetronal so closely resemble sulphonal and veronal in their
influence that we do not deem it necessary to introduce them as separate
agents. They have gained no ground in the past seventeen years, while the
two latter have increased in favor.


Sedatives Used for Their Influence on General Nervous Irritability—Inorganic Nerve

tives.
BROMINE. STRONTIUM BROMIDE. AMMONIUM VALERIANATE,
BROMIDES. BROMOFORM. HYDROCYANIC ACID.
AMMONIUM BROMIDE. HYDROBROMIC ACID.
BROMINE.

Symbol—Br.

A solution is made by dissolving 160 grains of potassium bromide in two
ounces of water, to which one troy ounce of bromine is added.

Its salts, the bromides, and hydrobromic acid are the preparations which
are commonly used in medicine.

Therapy—The agent uncombined is but little used. It was originally believed to assist metabolism like iodine, and investigations were conducted in
that line. In all cases of dyscrasia it was used, but was finally abandoned. It
was used universally during the American Civil War as an application in hospital gangrene, and was sometimes given as an internal antiseptic.

The general effect of bromine is that of a nerve sedative and antispasmodic. Its influence on the circulation of the nerve centers causes a marked
reduction of nerve force. This characteristic influence is exercised in all the
compounds of bromine, modified, of course, by the therapeutic influence of the
substance with which it is combined, producing characteristic properties permanent in the individual combination.

BROMIDES.

Potassium bromide. Dose from ten to thirty grains.

Character—The compounds of bromine with the alkaline earths are
isomorphous compounds—white granular crystalline solids, readily soluble
in water, sparingly soluble in aleohol. They exhibit in a more or less modified form, as has been said, the characteristic properties of the bromine.

Physiological Action—The effect of the bromides in large doses, upon the
animal economy, is that of universal depression similar in many ways to that
of gelsemium, but not as quickly induced, and more permanent, as inorganic
salts are by no means as quickly eliminated as organic remedies. Repeated
and continued doses of the former are usually necessary to induce the characteristic phenomena, although sensitive patients exhibit them after comparatively small doses. There is slowly progressive paralysis first of the motor and
finally of the sensory nerves. There is a paralysis of the voluntary muscles
with trembling and uncertain gait, with ultimate inco-ordination. Muscular
contractility is abolished more or less completely.

The capillary contraction finally induces an extreme inefficient capillary
circulation, with a marked and characteristic pallor. There is an interference
with metabolism and with the oxidation of the blood, which results in more or
less complete anemia.

There is a characteristic fetor of the breath and an eruption on the skin,
at first simple or papular, then similar to acne and finally pustular, ulcerative
and suppurative, becoming furuncular in character.

The bromides are eliminated with every secretion, but so slowly that in the
doses usually prescribed there is accumulation of the salts in the system from
excess of ingestion over excretion. These have been found in the urine nearly
forty days after the administration of the remedy had ceased.

Specific Symptomatology—The direct indications for the use of a bromide
are nervous excitement, nervous paroxysms or spasms from irritation, exalted
nerve action from temporarily increased nerve force, fullness of the capillary
circulation, and a marked determination of the blood to the nerve centers.

In anemia, in atonicity, relaxation or flaccidity of the general muscular
structure, the bromides are contra-indicated.

As their chemical reaction is alkaline, their chemical influence during protracted fevers when the secretions are all deficient, including the acids, increases the condition. There is, of course, an excess of the alkaline elements
in the body fluids. When as at this time the mucous membranes are dry and
dark, the tongue thin, pointed, dark coated teeth covered with sordes; give
instead, hydrobromic acid, as the bromides are contra-indicated.

Therapy—tThey are applicable in all forms of nervous irritation, with or
without spasm, but they should be given in conformity with its specific symptomatology.

Spasms of a general and also of a local character, with cerebral fullness
or fullness of the nerve centers, congestive nervous irritation are relieved by
the bromides.

In acute cerebral, spinal or cerebro-spinal inflammation the bromides are
indicated because of their direct influence upon the vasomotor system. In the
delirium of fevers with their indications they act promptly. Their influence is
greatly enhanced by combination with ergot, where the capillary circulation of
the brain is very full.

SEDATIVES USED ON GENERAL NERVOUS IRRITABILITY 117

The bromides are in constant use to anticipate or control convulsions,
their antispasmodic influence being constant and reliable. Whether the spasms
are infantile, hysterical, puerperal or epileptiform, the bromides can be given
according to the indications named, usually with good results.

The bromides have been more generally prescribed in epilepsy than any
other agent. It is in these cases that their physiological influence has been
studied, as the condition known as bromism has been often induced. BrownSequard’s formule for the treatment of epilepsy were at one time widely used.
The following was the one used for children from eight to twelve years of age.

M. Sig. Take two drams morning and noon, and three drams at night,
freely diluted with water. When the convulsions are reduced in number or
cease entirely, the size and frequency of the dose is diminished. It is sometimes given only when the paroxysms can be anticipated.

He advised the substitution of the infusion of digitalis instead of columbo
when the heart is feeble or when there is general weakness.

The author advises adherence in these cases, to the rules herein laid
down as indicated for the use of the Bromides, and their avoidance, when contra-indicated, as far as possible.

In cases of epilepsy where the indications are plain and the influence of
these agents seems to be beneficial, it is sometimes necessary to keep the patient
under their influence for some months, and sometimes for a year or two, notwithstanding certain unpleasant cutaneous results. Very small doses at long
intervals will often keep up the good results.

- In cases resulting from injury or from organic lesion, no permanent results
are likely to be obtained.

Further on in this work, in considering the compounds of sodium and
potassium, I have suggested that the physician exercises too little care, in
selecting that compound of an alkaline earth, which is indicated in the particular case which he then has under observation. We have under consideration
several bromides with a different base. The base exercises an influence that
is very seldom considered, when our thought is fixed upon the desired action
of the bromine.

Every element in any compound, influences its characteristic therapeutic
action to a greater or less extent. The potassium influence in every compound of potassium must be considered. This agent is plainly sedative or even
depressant to muscular contractility. This influence, with the nerve sedative
influence is characteristic of bromine also. Consequently this combination
should be selected when an agent is needed not only to reduce nerve irritation
but to reduce muscular activity, as in the case of powerful muscular spasm.

Potassium Bromide acts upon the stomach, reducing muscular power, nerve
tone, and glandular activity. To a certain extent this is also its influence upon
the bowels. It suspends peristaltic action. This influence, pushed, induces irritation which may be followed by inflammation. Such being the case, potassium
bromide should be used only when these organs are intact, exercising full
power, and should be discontinued when that power shows signs of abatement.
By the above influence this remedy impedes its own absorption.

Potassium Bromide is given with good results in whooping--cough, in
paroxysmal asthma, in vomiting of pregnancy and in irritative or reflex bron-

chial cough; also in reflex palpitation and in some forms of cardiac neuralgia
and in gastrodynia.

The Sodium Bromide is more kindly in its influence than the potassium
salt. It does not irritate the stomach, and is thus more rapidly absorbed. Its
alkaline influence against hyperacidity is more readily exercised. When needed
for general nervous irritation when arterial tonus is low, this agent is preferable. It is selected for infants and those aged and feeble.

Lithium is the remedy to assist in tissue metamorphosis and in the elimination of urea, the urates and uric acid. Consequently in lithemia, when there
is nervous excitement, irritation or spasm, where the blood is loaded with these
substances, the bromide of lithium will be the most serviceable. It works
specifically upon the kidneys, soothing irritation and stimulating functional
activity. Although the Bromides are often advised promiscuously in rheumatism, the lithium bromide is the indicated remedy—generally because of the
condition named above.

The Lithium Bromide is selected when with nervous excitability there is
lithemia with or without renal or cystic irritation.

In irritation or irregularity of the heart’s action from the above causes,
the bromides are directly indicated. The usual heart tonics, such as digitalis
and cactus, will increase the disorder. In rapid heart from irritation of the
sympathetic, we have had this fact confirmed in a remarkable manner.

In delirium tremens, in hysterical mania, nymphomania or satyriasis, or in
other forms of irritation of the sexual organs with excitement, the bromides
are certain in their action.

In sexual hyperesthesia so evidenced with excessive determination of
blood, potassium bromide is the remedy. The effect of this agent in removing
sexual feeling and diminishing sexual power and the power of erection, is due
to the permanency of its influence in inducing capillary contraction, producing
a local anemia.

The bromide of sodium acts nicely in insomnia from nervous excitement
and overwork of the brain, overstrain of the nervous system.

In the administration of morphine per os or opium in any form, nausea
and excitement, and in some cases, dangerous phenomena are apparent in pations, women of a nervous temperament with disordered stomach. These,
often attributed to idiosyncrasy, are sometimes entirely overcome by administering the agent with small doses of the bromides. The most desirable influence of the opium salt is then obtained. This is especially true where there is
gastric hyperacidity.

There are certain forms of indigestion which need a bromide. These are
accompanied with some nerve excitement, functional heart irregularity, or palpitation. Five or ten grains of the strontium bromide, repeated as needed
especially if there is hypcresthesia is the superior agent.

In certain cases of deep seated stubborn rheumatism, fifteen grain doses of
the bromide of potassium has been given three times a day with good results.

I believe that a bromide has a direct influence on the nerve irritation
eaused by the cutting of teeth in infants. I have depended for years on small
doses one-half to one grain, given every half hour to one hour to effect, when
there is excessive irritation pointing to the gums or teeth.

AMMONIUM BROMIDE.
Synonym—Bromide of Ammonium.

Administration—The dose is from two to twenty grains, and it is given in
oe in syrup or elixir. A dose of ten grains may be repeated every two
ours.

## Page 106

SEDATIVES USED ON GENERAL NERVOUS IRRITABILITY 119

Specific Symptomatology—This agent is a nerve sedative when the cerebral or nervous excitement is due to exhaustion, feebleness and over-worked
condition of the nervous system. It is the most active of the stimulating sedatives. It will exalt the enfeebled nerve force by its stimulating influence, and
by the soothing influence of the bromine the irritation is relieved, the excitement is quieted and restful sleep will follow.

Therapy—It is an excellent remedy when the nerve sedative is needed in
asthenic conditions. It improves the enfeebled, irregular and irritable heart
action under these circumstances and increases the pulse. It lacks much of
the depressing influence of the other bromides upon the heart. It will more
quickly irritate a sensitive stomach than the others. In erratic sexual excitement from exhaustion or over-indulgence; in spermatorrhea with sudden
spasms of sexual excitement followed by complete relaxation, feebleness and
coldness of the parts, this is a temporary remedy. Tonics must be given with
it. It will control undue nocturnal excitement and emissions, during the recovery from the use of tonics. It is not a good remedy to persist in, in any
case. It is the best of the bromides for epilepsy when there is feebleness and

lack of capillary fulness in the nerve centers—a tendency to anemia of these
centers. ‘

STRONTIUM BROMIDE.

Synonym—Bromide of Strontium.

Formula—SrBr-+6H,0.

The strontium bromide seems to exercise no independent influence on the
muscular structures. Instead of irritating the stomach or intestinal tract, it
first soothes these organs; then acts as a tonic, regulating their secretions,
neutralizing excessive acidity, and promoting normal functional activity. At
the same time it exercises the full bromine influence on the nervous system. It
is thus an exceedingly desirable agent when there is atonicity, or even actual
disease of the stomach or intestinal tract.

Therapy—This bromide takes the place of other alkaline agents in the
treatment of disordered digestion with a sedative influence added. This is
especially true in cases of the so-called nervous dyspepsia.

Germain-Sée reports a series of thirty-two cases of dyspepsia in which
the condition was in all cases promptly ameliorated. Some of these were suffering from dilatation. Several of them have been cured. M. Sée calls special
attention to the fact that from the beginning there was ‘‘a notable diminution
of gases.’’? The bromide of strontium he said, ‘‘acted against both the acetic
and lactic acid fermentations, and especially against the gases of decomposition.’’ M. Sée exhibited the bromide of strontium in daily quantities of from
two to four grams, divided into three doses and adminstered with meals. He
concluded his report to the French Academy in the following words: ‘‘It produces no distressing effect upon the stomach, even when given in elevated
doses, and it may even be taken in quantities of four grams (one dram), maximum, with each meal.’’

The bromide of strontium seems to be better borne by the stomach than
any other alkaline bromides. This is indeed important, as perhaps one-half
of the difficulties in which a bromide must be prescribed, are complicated with
stomach troubles. It is further important because the strontium salt is not
irritating to the stomach surfaces, and at the same time it is sedative, and
tonic, and neutralizes excessive gastric acidity, as above stated.

120 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

In its sedative influence, it is in every way similar to sodium bromide. The
strontium salt is anti-fermentative. It is a sedative also and valuable in
neurasthenia, diabetes and albuminuria. I am prescribing it now quite generally instead of other bromides.

The dose is the same as the potassium or sodium salt. In those conditions
known as nervous dyspepsia, it will be found to be the very best possible sedative. It should cure some of these cases with no other internal remedy. My
own experience confirms the above observations of Germain-Sée.

BROMOFORM.

Synonym—Tribromethane.

Formula—CHBr,

Physiological Action—It is a motor depressant of much activity. It has
produced death in a few cases, and in several instances it has produced collapse, with depression of the heart and respiration, great muscular relaxation, coldness of the skin and extremities, cerebral congestion and contraction of the pupils.

erapy—It is an anzsthetic, but has not as yet been generally used for
that purpose. It has a depressing influence upon the vaso-motor system, but
does not actively depress the heart. It is antispasmodic to a marked degree. It
is an antiseptic and analgesic.

It was in quite common use among prominent physicians at one time in the
treatment of whooping cough. Some are yet enthusiastic in its praise and others
are apathetic.

The following method for the preparation of an emulsion of bromoform is
advised:

Tinct. Tolutani,................ ii
Syrupi Tolutani,........

Mix the bromoform with the tincture of tolu and add gradually to the
mucilage and syrup, previously mixed in the bottle. Shake vigorously and dilute
with the spearmint water. Dose, from one-half to one dram.

HYDROBROMIC ACID.

Formula—HBr.

The solution of hydrobromic acid gas in water produces the liquid acid of
pharmacy. It is a colorless liquid with the characteristic properties of the mineral acid. The official acid contains about ten per cent of the gas.

Administration—It should be given in from fifteen to thirty drop doses,
diluted, every two hours, until the condition is much improved, when the doses
may be given farther apart and other treatment resumed.

Specific Symptomatology—In conditions where a nerve sedative is demanded and where there is a deficiency of normal acids, evidenced by a thin,
red, dry tongue, long, narrow and pointed, with red mucous membranes, with the
conditions hereafter named, hydrobromic acid is indicated.

_ The symptoms for which this agent will be found specific are: Wild, erratic
and unpleasant dreams, constantly present when the patient is asleep, for a few

days preceding actual delirium; face flushed, pupils dilated, increasing dullness
with disinelination to consecutive thought. "This is followed by mumbling and
incoherent talking in the sleep, which rapidly increases as the fever increases,
to extreme dullness and coma, with the characteristic accompaniments, constant
muttering, picking at the bed-clothes, involuntary discharges, etc.

Therapy—The writer has not been able to find any agent which will
take the place of this remedy under the conditions above named in the delirium
of typhoid fever. It is true beyond cavil that if the delirium of any fever
is kept in abeyance and the mind is kept clear, all other conditions are very
much more amenable to treatment. Experience has taught us that this is so
important that in severe cases of delirium other treatment at times must be
suspended until this result has been accomplished.

In these cases if there be widely dilated pupils, and especially if the enteric symptoms are marked, ergot in ten drop doses will greatly assist its

In nervous wakefulness, present in some fevers, or where the patient is
terrorized by a seeming inclination to fall from great heights as soon as he falls
into a doze, the sleep disturbed by frightful dreams, the agent is specific. This
condition sometimes follows the administration of quinine and opiates in conjunction. A single dose of fifteen drops of dilute hydrobromic acid will often
be followed by a refreshing night’s sleep.

The action of this agent in general, is identical with that of the bromides
of sodium and potassium, except that the proportion of bromine present is much
less, and to produce the marked effects of bromine, doses sufficiently large to
sometimes produce gastric irritation must:be given. It is therefore not a remedy
aH epilepsy, but it has a field of action in which it greatly exceeds the alkaline

ts.

AMMONIUM VALERIANATE.

Synonym—Valerianate of Ammonium.

Formula—NH,C,H,0,

Administration—It is given in doses of from two to ten grains. Five
grains may be given for a sufficient time in syrup or elixir.

Physiological Action—The ammonium valerianate paralyzes the spinal
cord in lower animals, and reduces nerve force in all cases in overdoses. It is
an active sedative of the stimulant type, similar to the bromide of ammonium,
but with a wider field. It is more palatable and more acceptable to the stomach. In combination with the bromides it produces very satisfactory results.

Therapy—This agent was once a panacea for ‘‘nervousness.’”’ It was
popular among nervous women with hysteria—any enfeebled condition with
hyperexcitability—and it is prescribed for its specific soothing and nerve
strengthening power during pregnancy, when the nervousness is a most troublesome symptom, preventing sleep at night, and rendering the wakeful hours
miserable. It is given at the menopause for this condition, and for the heat
flushes complained of at that time.

It is indicated for nervous excitement with patients where there is gastric
acidity in excess with feeble, hysterical or nervous patients.

HYDROCYANIC ACID DILUTE.

Synonym—Prussic acid.

Formula—HCN.

Administration—The dose of the acid should not generally exceed three
drops, although four drops is declared as the maximum dose.

Five or ten drops in a half of a glass of water, a teaspoonful given every
hour or two for a short time will produce good results. The dose should be
frequently repeated because of its evanescent effect. One and two drop doses
are often sufficient.

If the patient is taking too much, the evidences are tightness in the region
of the stomach, weight on the top of the head and dizziness or faintness. It
should be promptly discontinued when these symptoms appear.

Toxicity—In full toxic doses the influence of hydrocyanic acid is almost
immediate. The patient gasps, struggles and becomes convulsed and falls. The
face becomes purple, the eyes are open and staring; the teeth are tightly shut
and froth exudes from the mouth. The heart continues to pulsate rapidly, in
some cases after the respiration has ceased.

In smaller but poisonous doses the heart becomes slow, the respiration
labored, the face more slowly cyanotic, and there is mental disturbance. This
may be followed by vomiting, complete unconsciousness; muscular spasm of local
groups of muscles, resulting in involuntary defecation, spasmodic and quickly
relaxing erections of the penis, collapse, and death quickly following. If life is
prolonged to thirty minutes hopes of restoration are entertained, as the volatile
oor of the agent causes its rapid elimination. Recovery takes place rapidly
if at all.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent is a nerve sedative to local nerve
irritations. It relieves reflex nervous irritation, also physical irregularities of nervous origin. It is advised in the reflex vomiting of pregnancy and
reflex vomiting induced by pain or local injury.

Since our knowledge of reliable vegetable sedatives has been perfected,
this erratic and dangerous remedy has justly fallen into disuse. It is now
quite fully replaced by others in its every field.

Therapy—In one case of persistent vomiting of pregnancy, the patient’s
life was endangered by its violence. I had given this agent continuously
with no effect. I then dilated the external os and cervix somewhat; overcame
constrictions and pressed out all the ruge. The vomiting still persisted, until
hydrocyanic acid was again administered when it ceased at once, permanently.

It is commonly used as a gastric sedative, especially for persistent vomiting of any character. It occasionally controls pain in the stomach, especially
in neurasthenics where there is persistent nervous vomiting, and in the reflex vomiting of phthisis. It is also used in the nervous regurgitation of food,
and relieves the various forms of coughs whatever the cause. It is used in
some cases of whooping cough.

It is credited with the relief of angina pectoris, and with the control of
irritable and irregular heart action, from overstimulation. It is used in tobacco and cigarette heart, and in some cases of difficult breathing from disturbed heart. It was used externally for pruritus, especially in pruritus vulve
of nervous patients during pregnancy. It has been applied to urticaria, erythema, and eczema.

Antidotes—In concentrated form, death results often too quickly for assistance. If time permits ammonia is inhaled, artificial respiration is induced
and chlorine gas is inhaled as it is chemically antagonistic.

Pilule Asafetide. Pills of Asafetida. Dose, one to four pills.

Tinctura Asafetide, Tincture of Asafetida. Dose, one to two drams.

Therapy—This agent is a mildly stimulating nerve sedative. Its soothing
influence upon the brain is of no mean order. This is especially observed in
hysterical conditions, in hystero-epilepsy and in hypochondriasis. It arrests
hysterical paroxysms and produces quiet and rest with a pleasant sense of exhilaration. It relieves the flatulence of hysteria also. In nervousness, especially
that of weakened and exhausted conditions, and of children, it is soothing, and
often wards off spasms.

In spasmodic conditions of the stomach and bowels with tympanites, in
the absence of active inflammation it is a remedy long used. In accumulations
of gas in the stomach or bowels it has been used to the best advantage.

In spasmodic bronchial affections, in whooping cough, and in asthma it
was a favorite with the older doctors. In the bronchial catarrhs of the aged and
infants it has been given with advantage, especially if nervous depression was

present. A three-grain pill was the celebrated ‘‘Keeley cure’’ for la grippe, and
those who have used the remedy in epidemic influenza are usually enthusiastic
in its praise.

SCUTELLARIA. SCUTELLARIA LATERIFLORA.

Synonyms—Sculleap, madweed, hoodwort.

Const1rueNTs—A bitter principle (crystalline glucoside), volatile oil, fat,
tannin, sugar.

PrEPARATIONS—Extractum Scutellarie Fluidum, Fluid Extract of
Scutellaria. Dose, from five to thirty minims. Infusum Scutellarie, Infusion of
Scutellaria.

Specific Scutellaria. Dose, from one to ten minims.

The remedy is usually prescribed in the form of the specific medicine. The
normal tincture is very satisfactory, and in some cases scutellerin is the best
form of the remedy to give. The glucoside in granules, which contain onetwelfth of a grain, will produce good results.

Specific Symptomatology—French advises this remedy for two distinct
lines of specific phenomena. The first is where there is irritability of the nervous
system, with restlessness and nervous excitability; inability to sleep without pain;
general irritability, with insomnia from local physical causes. The second is


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 111

124 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

where there is nervous disorder, characterized by irregular muscular action,
twitching, tremors and restlessness, with or without inco-ordination. These symptoms are found in chorea, paralysis agitans, epilepsy and delirium tremens. Its
soothing influence continues for a protracted period, after the agent is discontinued. It is not a remedy of great power, but when indicated is of much
service.

Its specific nerve sedative properties were those observed by the older
writers who obtained this influence from a strong infusion which without doubt
will yield results not obtained from small doses of the finer pharmaceutical
preparations.

Therapy—lIts soothing influence upon the nervous system conduces to
quiet and restful sleep. In large doses in delirium tremens, it is a sufficient
remedy. Its influence will be enhanced by combining it with capsicum, the
tincture of red cinchona, or some other non-alcoholic stimulant. Combined
with macrotys, the value of both these agents is increased in their adaptability
to chorea.

In restlessness, or in nervous excitability producing insomnia, and in
prolonged fevers, it promotes sleep and at the same timé stimulates the skin
and kidneys to increased activity. Its soothing influence is retained after the
agent is discontinued. The agent was at one time supposed to exercise an

influence over the spasms of hydrophobia, but it is doubtless too feeble for such
& purpose.

HUMULUS. HUMULUS LUPULUS.

Synonym—Hops.

Part Employed—The strobiles.

ConsTITUENTS—Volatile Oil, Resin, Trimethalamine, Asparagin, Tannin.

Lupulinum, Lupulin, is a granular powder separated from the strobiles
of hops and is bright brownish-yellow in color, with the odor and taste of the
drug, in which its principal strength resides. Dose, from five to ten grains.

PrEPARATIONS—Tinctura Humuli, Tincture of Hops. Dose, from one to
two drachms. Extractum Lupulini Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Lupulin. Dose,
from ten to sixty minims. Specific Lupulin. Dose, from one to ten minims.,

Action—Tonic, nervine, hypnotic.

* Physiological Action—Hops stimulate the stomach, improve its tone, encourage the appetite and assist the digestion. They add force and volume
to the heart, and when that organ is irregular from nervous irritation or from
Bones gastric irritation, act as a soothing agent to overcome those conitions.

Specific Symptomatology—The influence of this agent is marked in those
cases of nerve irritation and wakefulness where anxiety and worry are the
eause. In this it is somewhat similar to hyoscyamus. It is more particularly
serviceable where sexual irritation, spermatorrhea and dread of impotence
are present, and where there is abnormal or erratic, and at times violent sexual
excitement.

Therapy—In all forms of nervous excitement it is soothing in its influence, and a hypnotic of much value. This is especially the case in hysteria and
in the sexual irritation of females.

In mild conditions of insomnia, with persistent worry, in patients recovering from neurasthenia, and in hysterical patients, or in cases where there is
no organic difficulty or pain to cause the wakefulness, small and frequent or
single full doses of this agent will have a marked tranquilizing effect. A pillow

MINOR NERVE SEDATIVES 125

of hops will have a soothing influence in some of these cases, and may be all
that is needed to induce sleep.

Fomentation made by dipping a muslin bag filled with hops into hot
water, wrung out and applied over painful acute local inflammations and painful swellings, is a favorite domestic measure. Applied to facial neuralgia,
or over an ulcerating tooth, or in the earache of children, it allays pain and

- promotes sleep.

In the treatment of delirium tremens a capsule containing a grain of
capsicum and eight grains of lupulin given during the intense excitement preceeding the attack, will sometimes ward it off. Half of a teaspoonful of each
of the tinctures in combination may be given. A strong infusion of hops and
cayenne pepper is excellent in this case to be drunk hot as demanded.

The anaphrodisiac influence of this agent suggests its use in priapism and
in chordee, and in spermatorrhea where these conditions exist, and where
there is sudden active determination of blood to the parts. It is not the remedy
when the parts are cold, weak, inactive and non-excitable, and where the
erections are feeble or impossible. Five to ten grains of lupulin at bedtime,
with ten or fifteen drops of the fluid extract of ergot in those cases where the
tendency to fullness of the circulation is marked, will preserve rest and quiet
for the night. A full dose of camphor monobromate with lupulin is excellent.

A suppository containing lupulin and camphor monobromate, five or six
grains of each, or the one-fourth of a grain of ergotin, may be inserted into the
rectum at bedtime with fine results.

The sedative effect of lupulin is exercised to a good advantage in the
treatment of nocturnal emissions by its influence in soothing the nerve centers, promoting rest and sleep, especially in hysterical patients, and in those
who suffer from irritation in the genito-urinary tract and in the control of
sexual excitement and desire. It prevents cerebral hyperemia and corrects
disorders of the gastro-intestinal tract. It modifies the secretion of the gastric fluids inhibiting the output of acids.

VALERIAN. VALERIANA OFFICINALIS.

Part Employed—tThe rhizome and roots.

ConstITUENTS—V olatile oil, valerianic, malic, acetic and formic acids; tannin, sugar, starch, mucilage, extractive, resin.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum valeriane fluidum, fluid extract of valerian.
Dose, ten minims to two drams. Specific valerian. Dose, five to sixty minims.
Tinctura valeriane ammoniata, ammoniated tincture of valerian. Dose, one to
two drams. Oleum valeriane, oil of valerian. Dose, one to five minima.

Physiological Action—Valerian in large doses stimulates the brain, causing headache, giddiness, perverted vision, restlessness, agitation, nausea.
Large doses of the oil cause increase of urine with slow pulse and drowsiness, ending in deep sleep. It lessens sensibility, motility and reflex excitability, and, if the dose be large enough, causes central paralysis. The first
effect is stimulation, followed by depression of the nerve centers.

Specific Symptomatology—Valerian is not a narcotic. Its influence upon
the nervous system is best obtained when the circulation of those centers is
inactive and feeble, especially when there is a paleness of the face and the
skin is cool. It is directly indicated in hysterical conditions of whatever
character with feebleness; with nervous excitement, and morbid vigilance, in
hysterical epilepsy, and in nervous headaches with some pallor. It is excellent
in the hysteria and nervous disturbances incident to the menopause. Its gen-

eral soothing effect in all these cases is desirable. It controls distress and
imaginary pain and produces quiet, permitting sleep and rest.

Therapy—This agent has long been known as a nervine. It is gentle
and soothing in its influence upon the nervous system, especially upon the
spinal centers. It is applicable in the nervousness of depression because of its
gentle stimulating influence, and in these cases its influence is heightened by
combining it with stimulants.

This result is effectually obtained from the valerianate of ammonium,
which is the most active of the valerian compounds. In conditions where the
nervousness is induced by hyperactivity—actual increased nerve force—or
where there is organic disease, it is not the remedy.

The agent exercises a good influence in combination with macrotys in the
treatment of chorea. Its influence upon disordered motility, although not
marked, is similar to that of cannabis indica, hyoscyamus and scutellaria.

In pruritus, with nervous excitement from feebleness, it is a desirable
agent. It has been used in stomach disorders and in diabetes, but its influence is not marked in these cases.

APLOPAPPUS. APLOPAPPUS LARICIFOLIUS.

Synonym—Herba del Pasmo.

LocaLiry—Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California and Northern Mexico.

This may be closely related to damiana. We insert it here, that it may
be kept before the minds of our readers until its properties are determined.
Webster and others mention it as a remedy in tetanus. Its infusion is used by
the native Mexicans and Spaniards for this condition. In convulsions—epileptic, hysterical and puerperal—it has been used. Its anti-spasmodic i
ence when used hypodermically must be studied.

More recent writers confirm Prof. Webster’s statements urging its use
in tetanus. In some parts of California, and New Mexico, there is but little
fear of tetanus, as they administer this remedy freely, almost ad libitum. It
is not poisonous, but few if any unpleasant results having been observed from
its action. It is given in the convulsions of childhood, whatever the cause
may be. A number of physicians confirm its influence in this class of disorders.

Several physicians have used the remedy in chorea, and claim that it is
superior to other agents in certain persistent, otherwise intractable cases. It
has controlled the spasms of meningitis, and will probably be an important
addition to the specific medication of that disease. In puerperal convulsions,
reports are not sufficient to direct us in its application. It has been observed
that when palpitation of the heart, or serious disturbance of the action of this
organ from a high degree of nervous excitement is present, this agent is curative. It must have further investigation.

CENANTHE. G2NANTHE CROCATA.

Synonym—Water Dropwort.

Constirvents—An acrid emetic principle (resin), essential oil.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Ginanthe. Dose, one-twentieth to one-half minim.

Administration—The profound influence of this agent upon the nerve
centers is quickly observed. It must be given in minute doses. Five drops of

the specific medicine in three, four or even six ounces of water will be found
sufficient. Fluid extracts or ordinary tinctures are not to be prescribed, beeause of uncertain strength.

Physiological Action—(Cnanthe crocata is extremely poisonous, and from
its resemblance to common garden parsley has frequently caused death in
men and animals. Toxic doses cause burning heat in the throat and stomach,
with disturbance of intellect, cardialgia, nausea, vertigo, violent convulsions,
furious delirium, or profound sleep; loss of sight, hearing and speech; rolling
of the eye-balls upward, feeble pulse, abolition of sensation and of motive
power, with increasing intellectual dullness. There are universal chills, rosecolored spots on face, breast and arms; lividity and swelling of the face, with
nies and bloody froth from mouth and nostrils, stertorous breathing, coma,

eath.

Autopsies performed on patients dead from the accidental use of this
agent have shown an engorgement of the blood vessels of the brain and cord.
There was effusion of blood and bloody serum in the occipital foramen. The
sinuses of the dura mater and the veins of the pia mater also were distended
with blood, as were also the sinuses of the vertebre. There were apoplectic
foci in the cerebral mass. There was serous effusion in the cellular tissue
beneath the arachnoid, in the ventricles and at the base of the brain.

Therapy—The agent acquired a reputation in the treatment of epilepsy.
It has cured a few violent cases and very many cases of petit mal. Fisk reported five cases cured, and other trustworthy investigators have had similar
results. It is indicated in those cases which, instead of fullness of the capillary
vessels of the brain and spinal cord, there is anemia of these organs more
or less marked. This distinction was made by Henning, and is an important
one.

It has proved of value in cases where epilepsy has resulted from injury,
in cases where there is an impairment of the brain structure and imperfect
cerebral circulation with impairment of the nutrition of the brain.

It has not increased in reputation, nor has our knowledge of its action
increased greatly during the past fifteen years. It deserves a closer investigation.

SOLANUM. SOLANUM CAROLINENSIS.

Synonym—Horse nettle.

PREPARATIONS—Tincture Solanum. Dose, from twenty to sixty minims.
Specific Solanum, made from the root. Dose from five to twenty minims.

ConstITUENTS—Solnine, Solanine, Solanidine, Solanic acid.

Therapy—The remedy has been used with some success in the treatment
of epilepsy. It was used in an Eastern hospital for epileptics experimentally,. with a reduction in the number of paroxysms of twenty-five per cent. It

may be given in all forms of epilepsy in sufficient frequent doses to produce
a sensation of dullness or drowsiness. It has cured some stubborn cases and
has relieved many. Its specific field is yet to be determined.

It has been used in the treatment of puerperal convulsions with satisfactory results, in a few cases. In hysterical paroxysms it has been useful.

128 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS
HERACLEUM. HERACLEUM LANATUM.

Synonyms—Masterwort, Cow Parsnip.

ConstrrvueNts—The root contains a volatile oil, and a crystallizable substance containing heraclin.

PRrEPARATIONS—A tincture, and a fluid extract. The dose of the tincture
is from five to sixty minims. Fluid extract from two to twenty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—Blood dyscrasia, with general local manifestations. The tongue is heavily coated with a pasty coat or furred. The mucous membranes are of a bluish or leaden color. The membranes of the throat
are discolored, with very sluggish circulation, appearing as if they would
slough. The breath has a bad odor. There are erosions of the mucous membrane of a whitish character. The pulse is full and sluggish, and there may
be a low grade of fever. In some cases the temperature is high, with a slow
pulse, the patient is drowsy, and there is general capillary stasis.

The remedy has not received general attention. Felter and Lloyd give
very limited action to it, but Dr. Vassar, of Ohio, has made some extended
observations, which are worthy of note, and should be confirmed or disproved,
by future thorough investigation.

Physiological Action—The doctor says the plant must not be confounded
with the wild parsnip, and similar plants. A good preparation of the green
root must be obtained to produce good results. The remedy is an irritant to
the skin, sometimes causing inflammation. Its poisonous properties are similar to those of the wild parsnip. It acts upon the nervous system as an antispasmodic. It produces, when taken in the mouth, a sensation of tingling,
prickling, a benumbing sensation upon the throat, fauces and tongue, similar
to that of echinacea, aconite and xanthoxylum. In fact, the doctor compares
it in its entire influence, with echinacea. It stimulates the pulse, and
strengthens the capillary circulation. With the tingling and numbness of the
throat, is difficult deglutition. Its antispasmodic influence seems to be exercised independent of the alterative influence the agent would exercise over
depraved blood, as a cause of spasms.

Therapy—It is given in general spasm in puerperal convulsions, and in
epilepsy. While Doctor Vassar has not used it in meningitis. his knowledge
of its influence suggests that it would be a valuable remedy in that disease.
In the treatment of convulsions, he would give as high as thirty drops of the
strong tincture. In the treatment of puerperal convulsions he gives it as
high as dram doses, until the patient is under control. He considers it as
useful as gelsemium or veratrum. He has used it in several cases. He gave
it in one extremely severe case of puerperal fever, where the temperature
was 106 degrees, and obtained highly satisfactory results. In this case, he
gave it in conjunction with small doses of jaborandi. He has treated several
eases of epilepsy with it, two of which were completely cured. The others
were benefited. He has given it in tonsillitis, diphtheria, and ulcerated sore
mouth. As a vegetable antiseptic, it has many of the properties of echinacea,
and some that echinacea has not. He has given it in cases of blood poisoning, with good results, but has not had an opportunity to observe fully, concerning its action for the same purposes, that echinacea is given as a corrective of bad blood.

He believes that it exercises an influence upon the capillary circulation
of the spinal cord, and upon the capillary circulation in general, similar to
that of ergot. He has obtained results from its use in several cases, similar
to those previously obtained from ergot.

MINOR NERVE SEDATIVES 129

He has given it in glandular swellings, where there ‘is threatened destruction of tissue, where the parts seem lifeless, or where there were foul
and indolent ulcers.

He has given it in nervous dyspepsia, with all the phenomena of that
complicated disorder. It is given in small doses, in these cases. It overcomes
a tendency to flatulence, preventing flatulent decomposition of the food, and
favoring digestion. It is especially demanded when there are offensive gases,
discharged after meals. When there is an excess of acidity in the stomach or
bowels, from any cause this acidity should be previously neutralized.

The sore mouth or sore throat that calls for this remedy is that accompanied with a cadaverous fetor to the breath, where there is a bad taste in
the mouth, the tongue very dirty and pasty in its coating. He intends to
investigate it in diphtheria farther, not having had an opportunity to make
an extended observation in this disease. \

In the treatment of the disorders of women, he finds it applicable in
amenorrhea, and especially in dysmenorrhea. In these cases the pains being
quite severe, before or immediately the flow starts, the agent seems to act
like gelsemium. If other specific indications are present the indicated remedy
is prescribed in conjunction with this. The agent will be found useful in certain forms of kidney trouble, and in the uric acid diathesis. It must have
further careful investigation as it promises to be an important remedy.

QUARANA. PAULLINIA SORBILIS.

Synonym—Brazilian Cocoa.

PrePaRATIONS—Extractum Guarane Fluidum. Fluid Extract Guarana.
Dose, five to thirty minims.

Extractum Guarane. Extract of Guarana. Dose, three to ten grains.

Specific Guarana, from one to fifteen minims.

ConstiTvents—Caffeine, Tannin, Volatile Oil, Saponin, Resin.

Physiological Action—In its influence it is a tonic and mild nerve stimulant and sedative. Gaurelle, who first called attention to it, mentioned it as a
most useful tonic in protracted convalescence. He had great confidence in
it in persistent diarrhcas, especially those of phthisis. Others have used it
successfully in chronic diarrheas.

Therapy—tThe fluid extract of this agent, given in doses of from ten to
thirty minims, has been used specifically in the treatment of headaches, other
than those due to actual disease of the stomach, as from catarrh or ulceration
or cancer. In many forms of headache, and especially the form due to functional gastric derangement, known as ‘‘sick headache,’’ it is certainly a serviceable agent.

PEONY. PEONIA OFFICINALIS.

Synonym—Piney.

PREPARATIONS—The tincture. Dose, from one to thirty minims.

Therapy—The agent is an antispasmodic. Through a mild but persistent
tonic influence, it is soothing to the nervous system of debilitated patient and
of the aged. It is curative wherever there is irregular muscular action. It is
useful in chorea, either alone or combined with other positively indicated remedies. It has been given with good results in convulsions of childhood, and

other convulsive phenomena, and its persistent use in epilepsy has resulted
satisfactorily in some cases. It is not a powerful remedy, but it is one that has
a steady and persistent influence, and will therefore be found of use as auxiliary to the action of positive but temporary remedies. It has been given
in whooping cough, and will probably be found valuable in the treatment of
other spasmodic coughs..

The juice has been expressed from the recent root, and has been administered in doses of from one to two drams. The powdered root in dram doses
has been given. Thirty grains of the powdered seeds have been administered
to overcome night terrors and nightmare in aged people and people afflicted
with these forms of chronic disease, accompanied with dropsy. It relieves all
forms of nervous irritation, and is beneficial in reflex irritability.

CHAPTER VI.
Depressants Used to Induce General and Local Anssthesia—Anssthetics.

CHLOROFORM. NITROUS OXIDE. MENTHOL.
ETHER. COCAINE. NOVOCAINE.
EUCAINE.
CHLOROFORM.
Formula—CHCl,.

Synonyms—Formy] chloride. Trichloromethane.

Physiological Action—Chloroform taken internally in sufficient quantity
is an irritant poison. Being insoluble and easily diffusible, it produces intense
local effects rapidly.:

It is an irritant and vesicant. Its influence when confined and evaporation prevented, is profound. It produces intense burning pain with subsequent
slight anesthesia. Taken into the stomach it produces pungent warmth, burning and finally, gastric irritation. In conditions of gastric pain with flatulence
it induces increased peristaltic action, relieves the pain, causes expulsion of
the flatus and acts as an antispasmodic.

When inhaled its influence is that of a sedative. If given in small quantity
with an abundance of air, there may be a little hysterical excitement, but the
patient quickly falls into an apparently natural sleep. The pulse becomes
round and full. The respiration becomes slower and regular and the face is
slightly flushed.

If increased to an excessive amount the face becomes pale, the breathing
becomes irregular, heavily stertorous and labored, and may cease suddenly.
The cheeks are puffed with the expiration. The heart’s action becomes rapid
and feeble, and the appearance is alarming. If the symptoms are not vigorously
eombated death may occur suddenly.

Therapy—When first discovered it was believed to be able to fill an important part in therapeutics. It was given internally in spasmodic conditions, often
with good results. It was used in whooping cough and other spasmodic coughs,
in asthma, in hysteria and in spasmodic pain. Its influence by inhalation so
quickly overshadowed all other influences that its internal use was neglected.
It is useful, however, internally in the above-named conditions and in hiccough, angina pectoris, biliary and nephritic colic and in simple acute painful
conditions. From half a dram to a dram internally, largely diluted, will produce a certain amount of anesthesia similar to that produced by its inhalation,
although not so profound.

DEPRESSANTS USED TO INDUCE ANSTHESIA 181

Its antiseptic influence renders it serviceable in fermentation and decomposition in the stomach, and a few drops taken in water stops many form of
nausea and vomiting. Five to ten drops on a lump of sugar will hold in check
many cases of sea sickness.

It is valuable in its external influence. It will relieve neuralgic pains,
lumbago, sciatica and many conditions where a local irritant is not contra-indieated. If the anodyne influence of the agent, in its external use, can be obtained
without its irritating effécts, its field is greatly widened. It is then applicable
to painful swellings and local inflammations—to rheumatic arthritis and to
inflamed joints. It is often combined in liniments with other anodyne remedies,
such as aconite, belladonna, opium, camphor and menthol.

This is accomplished to an extent by using it in the form of a spray when
local anesthesia results. Combined with menthol and sulphuric ether in the
form of a spray, it will be found sufficiently anesthetic for the opening of
boils and abscesses, for the extirpation of superficial growths and for various
minor operations.

A doctor was called to a very young infant where there was ulceration
of the umbilicus. On examination he found it infected with maggots. He applied chloroform very slowly drop by drop, destroying them all quickly. This
an be used in the nostrils in filthy cases, where they are infested, and in other

ocalities.

Dr. Bogart says that in violent paroxysms of whooping cough, if chloroform be administered as the paroxysm approaches, until the coughing stops
it will prevent subsequent paroxysms, especially early ones, and if pushed will
result in a cure, in a proportion of the cases. Relief only results in other cases.

Dr. Lankford gave fifteen drops of this agent fully diluted with water in
a very severe case of nettle rash, and relieved the condition quickly.

A French authority gives ten or fifteen drops of chloroform in water,
where from sunstroke with intense cerebral disturbance, the heart needs a
profound stimulant. Chloroform diminishes the asthenic irritability of the
heart and nerve centers, and controls the circulation to a beneficial extent.

In large doses of from one-half a dram to one and one-half drams, internally it has been given properly diluted by a number of physicians.

A few drops of chloroform diluted and given internally will sometimes
relieve severe abdominal pain.

It will control congestive chill and re-establish active capillary circulation;
it will also prevent the chill in malarial conditions.

General Anzsthesia—The science of surgery owes its development to the
introduction of anesthetics. The growth of surgery for all purposes, except to
save life alone, has been most rapid since the American Civil War. Cosmetic
surgery, plastic surgery, abdominal surgery, pelvic and surgery for the relief
of deformities and for the cure of existing chronic conditions, have all had
their birth and development in that time. General anesthesia has been the greatest boon to the human race. It is not necessary here to detail the application
of anesthesia to specific surgical conditions.

The administration of chloroform is demanded in all cases of severe pain
not relieved by other anodynes, and in all painful operations; also in convulsions as an antispasmodic, in the convulsions of strychnia and other convulsive
poisons, and to an extent in the convulsions of cerebro-spinal meningitis,
tetanus and hydrophobia. In violent convulsive coughs, in reducing dislocations and setting fractured bones, in nephritic and renal colic, in the pains of
labor, in reducing strangulated hernias, in hysteria and angina pectoris. In
convulsions from whatever cause the administration of chloroform is advisable
in the careful judgment of the physician. In puerperal convulsions there is
often no other apparent recourse. In the convulsions of childhood and infancy

it is seldom needed, as the list of efficient antispasmodics, for internal or hypodermic use, is now great, and one or more is usually at hand. These are
usually more permanent in their effects than anesthetics. In the spasms of
epilepsy its use is often demanded, if no more than for temporary relief.

In violent chorea, especially the malarial form, severe and intractable to
the usual methods of treatment, chloroform given for a short time at intervals
of from three to six hours, will modify the severity of the movements. In
whooping cough a few drops may be held in the hand to the child’s nostrils,
and will modify the paroxysm. In violent coughs of a reflex origin chloroform
is of much benefit.

Special Administration—The use of chloroform by inhalation for the production of profound anesthesia far overshadows all its other uses, It has been
in constant use since 1847, when it was introduced to supplant ether. It is
agreeable, speedy, profound and in every way convenient, and does not produce the disagreeable after-effects of either. The opinion of many careful administrators is that it is hardly as safe as ether even in safe hands, and that it
demands absolutely expert administration.

Its administration is no longer trusted to other than experts. If intrusted
to students, or inexperienced newly graduated physicians, or self-confident isolated physicians with limited experience, who do not appreciate the extreme
danger and responsibility, it is a dangerous agent. The apparent mortality
from its use is much greater than that of ether, which is undoubtedly due in
part to faulty administration. The agent produces a profound influence upon
the respiratory centers and upon the heart, and this effect is often obtained
suddenly. There are usually evidences of its approach which are quickly observed by an experienced administrator and avoided or successfully combated.

In its administration the physical condition of the patient must be fully
considered. If there be any quantity of albumen in the urine, if there be
diabetes mellitus, weak heart, with insufficient valvular action, or if there be
dropsical conditions of the heart or thorax, it must be avoided for protracted
operations, and given with greatly increased care for minor or short operations.

In the preparation of the patient the stomach should be empty, the neck
entirely free from any tight bands, the clothes should be open and loose, to
obtain unrestricted circulation and respiration, and the patient should have
unquestioned confidence in the administrator.

He should be kept in a horizontal position and in no case should the agent
be administered in a sitting posture, especially when operations involving the
nerves of the face are contemplated.

Esmarch’s method of administration is now almost universallly adopted
by clinical surgeons. It consists of the use of a thin gauze spread over a wire
frame which lies loosely over the mouth and nose. On to this the chloroform is
dropped—drop by drop—slowly but continuously, the patient breathing
through the gauze. There is no concentration of the vapor and there is a free
admixture of air. This produces no previous stage of resistance or excitement,
but few if any untoward symptoms appear, the after results are not unpleasant, and the amount of the agent necessary to be administered is greatly
lessened..

Restorative Methods—During the administration, the pulse and respiration are constantly watched, and any variations from normal carefully observed, and if at all conspicuous the agent must be discontinued and restorative
method adopted. The pupil contracts at first, but if danger appears it dilates.
The use of the nitrate of amyl] inhalation, the injection of brandy, strychnine,
digitalis, nitro-glycerine or carbonate of ammonium solutions will usually restore the pulse if failure is apparent. If respiration stops, the patient should
be inverted, and artificial respiration persistently applied for at least an hour,


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 120

DEPRESSANTS USED TO INDUCE ANASSTHESIA 183

with flagellation or hypodermic stimulation. Orificial surgeons claim to have
restored many patients by the dilatation of the anal sphincter.

The injection of one-half dram to two drams of hypodermic lobelia, is now
found to be a reliable method of restoration, promoting the influence of and
acting in harmony with other authorized methods.

The Laborde method of tongue traction, when adopted, has produced
excellent results, and should be well understood. It consists of traction on the
tongue from its base, steadily and rhythmically, imitating in time the normal
respiratory movements.

Any method is enhanced in its influence by heat—by immersion of the
patient in a hot bath, or by the pouring of a stream of hot water of from 110
to 120 degrees from a height moving slowly up and down the spine. Care must
be exercised or the shock from this will be too great.

The free use of strychnine for a day or two before the administration of
chloroform, with a single hypodermic of morphine at the time, is a common
custom. This is believed to prevent shock, to avoid after-emesis and to permit
of more ready anesthesia with a less quantity of the anesthetic.

Anesthesia in Labor.

In no condition is chloroform administered with so much assurance, with
so little anticipation of serious results and with so much satisfaction to the
patient, as in labor. In these cases, if the usual care be taken, no unpleasant
results occur. There is a record of a few deaths having occurred since its introduction, but the percentage is infinitely smaller than in any other class of
operations. It is in every way superior to ether because of the pleasantness
of its administration and lack of after effects.

The dangers from its use are in producing too complete anmsthesia early
in the case, or in the expulsive stage, paralyzing the involuntary muscular fibers
and preventing proper contraction and subsequent involution, thus promoting
post partum hemorrhage. There is another danger and that from administration when the patient is in a semi-recumbent or sitting posture. Its paralyzing effects on the heart may be quickly induced between the pains, but if
pain recurs at once, injurious influences will be overcome. The writer has
thought that the safety of the agent in labor was due to the antagonizing influence of the regularly recurring severe pains. If serious symptoms suddenly
appear they can be overcome by lowering the head and inducing a recurrence
of the pain.

In the second stage of labor a few breaths of dilute chloroform vapor taken
just as the pain approaches, will often produce great relief with no apparent
effect upon the consciousness of the patient. Many physicians allow the patient
to hold a folded handkerchief in her hand on which a few drops have been
poured and to administer it herself on the occurrence of the pain. This is a
careless habit and should not be tolerated. When the pains are abnormal,
cutting, aggravating and irregular in character, an increased quantity of chloroform will often change them quickly to normal.

It will dilate a rigid os and promote general relaxation of the parts, will
encourage diaphoresis by overcoming nervous irritability, and will promote the
labor in a kindly manner. It is seldom that complete anesthesia is essential
except in complicated cases, or in cases of primiparm where there is slow dilatation of the external parts, in the expulsion of the head, or in instrumental cases.
In these, complete anesthesia need not be maintained for a great length of
time. The physician is censurable who refuses from prejudice to use safe

anesthesia in severe cases, or when indicated in labor. The day of experimentation on suffering mothers should now be long past.

The duty of the profession to the obstetric woman, the importance of
relieving as large a proportion of the pain as possible, has been overlooked
almost, until the present time. It is just now that there is a universal recognition of the need of measures that carry the mother safely through this most
critical time of her life, with the least possible pain. It is surprising how
much need there is yet, of education, both of the mother and the physician,
in the fact that the old traditions that a mother must suffer pain in labor,
are groundless, and that in line with all other improvements and advancements that have been made the physician must see to it that the woman
passes through this period with a minimum of pain.

In addition to the use of general anesthesia by inhalation, a combination
of hyosine, morphine, and cactine quite well known in America, at the
present time, has been used for perhaps ten years for its hypnotic influence.
This has its many advocates. There are some objections and an occasional
accident, but properly managed it renders the patient insensible to pain,
with comparatively little danger. The combination is made in tablets of two
strengths. One contains morphine hydrobromide 1/4 grain, hyosine hydrobromide 1/100 grain, and cactine 1/67 grain, a concentration of cactus
grandifloris. The other strength is just one-half of this formula. This is
the strength used during labor.

An irrational unjustifiable publicity has been given to the use of scopolamine and morphine in producing what has been sensationally called ‘*Twilight Sleep.’’ Such publicity can result only in serious harm. The use of
these agents in hospital practice with trained nurses and expert assistants
produces an unconsciousness which permits the labor to proceed to completion, without the knowledge of the patient, or if conscious of pain it is forgotten when the pain has passed. The original advocates of the method
have not declared it safe for common use, and all who use these agents appreciate the danger, especially to the child.

A reliable physician has recently informed me that he has used heroin
with as good results as any other agent, and believes that it will be found
to be safer. In uncomplicated cases not prolonged, I have for many years
used a simple combination which has proved effective. The method of its
preparation is found under hyoseamus on page — of this volume.

Of this just before the pains are well established, I begin by giving a
teaspoonful every fifteen or twenty minutes until the patient shows evidences
of being well influenced by the compound; then with chloroform, short of
unconsciousness, the patient is kept in a comfortable condition until the final
pains, when total unconsciousness with the chloroform may be carefully sustained for a sufficient period. This course will not carry enough of the anodyne agents to give complete relief in extreme or protracted cases. It is in
the medium uncomplicated cases which should constitute the mass of labors,
that it works well, without danger to the mother or the child, if carefully
adjusted.

ETHER.

Synonym—Sulphuric Ether.

Formula—(C,H,),0.

Physiological Action—When inhaled, ether causes an increase in force
and frequency of the pulse and sustains for a while the heart’s action, while
chloroform depresses it. It depresses the respiratory centers and irritates the


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 122

DEPRESSANTS USED TO INDUCE ANASSTHESIA 135

respiratory tract, but this influence is not so immediately dangerous; hence its
general use as an anesthetic. If the respiratory centers are not paralyzed it
will sustain its stimulating action on the heart often through a prolonged and
profound anesthesia.

Ether is a common and comparatively safe anesthetic. It produces local
anesthesia, also, by the abstraction of heat. Internally it is an active poison,
although less so than chloroform. Death occurring more slowly, there is more
time for the administration of restoratives. Artificial respiration and the application of electricity to the spinal centers and to the respiratory muscles are
the available means of restoration.

For anesthetic purposes ether is found, as stated, to be safer than chloroform, but its slowness of action, its irritating influence upon the respiratory
tract, the prolongation of the stage of excitement and the subsequent discomfort, the disagreeable stomach and head symptoms, are all so objectionable that
they overbalance the danger from chloroform. With careful, confident surgeons, however, chloroform usually has the preference.

Administration—General anesthesia was discovered through the use of
ether. Its administration is conducted similarly to that of chloroform, except
that the vapor is kept more confined. It produces a preliminary stage of excitement, with flushed face, succeeded by pallor. A larger quantity and more
time is necessary than with chloroform. It often induces violent vomiting,
which is protracted during the recovery from its influence. During its administration the pulse and respiration should be closely watched. Slow, shallow or irregular respiration must be quickly observed and the agent withdrawn until the respiration is increased in strength—if necessary, by artificial
means. Irregular action of the heart must have the same caré, but with ether
the respiratory symptoms are likely to appear first. It is used in all cases
where a general anesthetic is needed. They need not be enumerated.

Ether has an unusual influence in reducing the temperature. The reduction in extreme cases amounts to nearly four degrees, and it is seldom less than
two. The patient must be prepared for so marked a reduction, as it may increase the shock and lessen the power of the system to react from the shock
after the operation. Every precaution should be taken to conserve the body

eat.

The vapor of ether is inflammable, and it must be administered with great
caution where there is danger of ignition.

Therapy—Internally ether has a sweet, pungent taste. It produces a sensation of warmth in the stomach and acts as a stimulant and a narcotic. It has
been used in spasmodic colic, in bilious and nephritic colic, and in neuralgic or
other pain in the stomach and in the intestines. It relieves flatulency, it stimulates gastric and intestinal secretion and increases peristaltic action. It is
given in angina pectoris, in spasmodic asthma and in heart failure after prostrating disease or after hemorrhage. Its influence, although prompt, is so transient that other stimulants either replace it or are used with it. Its hypodermic use as a stimulant has the objection of being liable to produce abscess.

Injected deeply over the main nerve trunk, it has cured persistent neuralgias, especially sciatica. A few drops of pure ether are used in the injection,
which may be repeated after twenty-four or forty-eight hours.

Ether spray applied to the surface is a local irritant and anesthetic. Its
inherent influence is enforced by the freezing effects of the extreme cold induced by its rapid evaporation. It has long been in use in minor surgical operations. Amputations have even been performed under its local influence. It
is used in this manner for neuralgias and local pains. The restoration of the
tissues after the freezing is often quite painful.

The following tabulated statement of the action of chloroform and ether
from The American Dispensatory will prove of value in comparing these two

important anaesthetic agents.

CHLOROFORM.

Agreeable to odor.

Pleasant to inhale..

Non-inflammable, but decomposes in presence of burning gas, liberating chlorine
gas, which is at once an active irritant.

Less irritant to the air passages.

Must be slowly administered.

Air to the extent of at least 97% per cent
should be mixed with the anesthetic
vapor.

Not more than 3 1-3 per cent with the inhaled air is safe.

Practically no reduction of temperature.

More apt to render the ideas and visions
pleasurable, the incoherent talk being of
a pleasant and not vulgar character.

Not admissible in weak heart.

Less irritant to the renal and pulmonary
tissues.
Effects more prompt and more prolonged.
Kills chiefly by cardiac paralysis; and quite
often primarily by asphyxia.
Danger signs, as of pulse, pallor, etc., exi

hibited as quickly as with ether, but too
late to be of value if cardiac paralysis

NITROUS OXIDE.

Formula—N,0,.

8 onyma—Laughing gas, nitrogen monoxide.

Physiological Action—If serious results occur there are short, frequent
and shallow respirations, quick pulse, stertorous breathing and cyanosis. But
few deaths have ever occurred from its use. It causes cerebral engorgement
and a consequent rise of arterial pressure. It is therefore contraindicated
with those who are predisposed to apoplexy or those advanced in years who, are ce to have atheromatous degeneration of the walls of the blood
vessels.

It has no irritant properties. Its peculiar influence in inducing extreme
hilarity when inhaled in small quantities has given it the name of laughing
gas. When taken in full quantities this effect is not apparent.

Therapy—The method of administration is to close the nostrils and cause
the patient to take long, deep inspirations of the gas through a tube in the
mouth. The angsthesia is immediate and complete and consciousness returns
suddenly with but few unpleasant effects. It is in general use only by dentists, although serviceable in many minor surgical operations.

Nitrous Oxide ges has been combined with oxygen gas and with ether
and chloroform to determine if possible an improved method of anmathesia.

DEPRESSANTS USED TO INDUCE ANASSTHESIA 187

Its combination with oxygen is advised for anethesia in anemic and debilitated patients suffering from heart or lung disease, in elderly patients, in
patients suffering from obstruction in the naso-pharynx, in patients that are
very susceptible to the nitrous oxide alone. The combination is slower, more
permanent, and less depressing in its influence than the nitrous oxide alone.

COCAINE. | COCAINE HYDROCHLORATE.

The alkaloid of Erythroxylon coca is a white, bitter, crystalline substance
soluble in water, ether and alcohol. When acted upon by hydrochloric
acid cocaine hydrochlorate is formed.

This salt in common use is dispensed as cocaine. It is a white, transparent, permanently crystalline powder, odorless and bitter, and produces, first,
tingling, then numbness of the tongue. It may be used hypodermically, usually in one, two, four or ten per cent solutions.

Physiological Action—Its internal use produces a sense of exhilaration.
It stimulates the brain, the muscular and mental powers are temporarily increased and a sense of power and endurance is experienced. This is followed
by lassitude, depression and melancholy. Its local application produces anemia
and coldness of the part to which it is applied, followed by an entire suspension of sensation. Its paralyzing influence upon the nerve terminals is
rapid and is conveyed upon the nerve filaments toward the nerve center.

In its application to the eye and exposed nerve endings in decayed teeth,
or in the gums for the extraction of teeth—in localities thus near the brain
—-serious results often occur, and sudden deaths are by no means infrequent
even when two per cent solutions are used. Although it has but little influence upon the skin intact, it acts quickly upon the mucous membrane and
upon the conjunctiva. It is in common use in ophthalmic practice and by
nose and throat specialists. Unpleasant results occur to all who use it, but
by sexperience they learn promptness in combating its influence.

Therapy—It is par excellence the great local anesthetic. It is in any
dose a dangerous agent, and this fact confines its use to minor operations,
where but a small quantity need be used.

If the danger element in the introduction of larger quantities could be
eliminated, nearly all of the minor operations and a large per cent of the
major operations could be performed with local instead of general anesthesia.

In all cases where its diffusion can be retarded and its influence confined
to the locality in which the operation is to be performed, larger operations
are possible with a smaller quantity of the agent.

Corning, of New York, in 1887 and 1888, performed thigh amputations
and joint resections and abdominal operations with good results by restricting the diffusion of the agent.

It is used in amputations of the fingers and the toes, in incisions and small
excisions, in stricture of the urethra, which is very susceptible to its action,
in phymosis, and, although very dangerous, in the extraction of teeth.

There is authority for the belief that many of the unpleasant effects of
the hypodermic use of cocaine can be prevented by introducing a drop or
two of the one per cent solution of nitro-glycerine with each injection of
cocaine. An objection to the use of cocaine is that surgical wounds do not
heal quite as readily where it has been used.

Schleich’s ‘‘Infiltration method’’ of local anrsthesia has not increased in
popularity to any great extent since this work was first published seventeen
years ago. It has the confidence of the profession, however, as it is devoid


<!-- chunk -->

of danger, and will accomplish good results for those who have patience in
conducting the method and are not too anxious for something new or for general anesthesia.

This method presumes injection into not beneath the skin. The solutions
contain a very small proportion of cocaine and morphine, and the local effect
is supposed to be due to compression of the capillaries and nerve filaments
by the infiltration. The point of a fine hypodermic needle is inserted into
the structure of the skin and a drop or two of the solution injected. It produces a wheal which soon becomes anesthetic. Into the outside border of this
wheal another insertion is made, and this leaves another wheal following on
the outer edge of each wheal. In the line of the incision to be made the wheals
are formed by frequent injections, until an anesthetic line, circle or area is
produced which retains the anesthetic for nearly half an hour with the introduction of a minimum amount of cocaine.

Schleich has applied the same method to the periosteum successfully and
operated upon the bones. He advises solutions made in three strengths as
follows, the first being strong for severe cases and the last being relatively
weak for simple operations.

From five to ten or fifteen drops of a twenty per cent aqueous solution of
cocaine in a teaspoonful of water will be found of service for severe acute
pain in the stomach. Its influence is very prompt. Excellent authority advises this in the treatment of gastralgia. Cases are cited illustrating immediate benefit. In various forms of neuralgia, its internal use is prompt and
satisfactory. In no case should such use be continued without the advice
of the physician.

To which a five per cent solution of carbolic acid is added.

Parvin states that in opening abscesses, extracting teeth, ligating hemorrhoids, operating for prolapse of the bowel, phimosis and paraphimosis, operations upon the vagina and uterus, amputation of the breast, removal of vascular tumors, curretting or cauterizing lupus, partial resection of various
bones, as the tibia, clavicle, sternum, ulna, humerus or femur—all these and
many other operations may be done by Schleich’s method with comparatively
no danger from the poisonous effects of the drug.

Cocaine is popularly used to relieve hay fever by spraying it into the
nose, but the danger of its too free use must be kept in mind. In nasal hemorrhage, whether accidental or incidental to the operation, it has restrained the
flow of blood in a few moments by its influence in producing anemia. This
effect is obtainable in all hemorrhages from mucous membranes, and has won
for the agent a reputation as a hemostatic.

In all cases where cocaine is incorporated in ointments it should be remembered that the salts of cocaine are insoluble in fats, while cocaine proper
is fully soluble and makes a superior ointment. In pruritus vulve it will give
quick relief locally applied; in vaginismus, however severe, it removes the
difficulty temporarily. In rigid os in labor, with dry and hot vagina, a suppository of cocaine will often correct the entire condition and relax the os
completely. In the urethral spasm after labor, with retention of urine, a few
drops of the two per cent solution, although not unattended with danger,
will often correct the difficulty.

The danger of establishing a pernicious habit of using the drug is infinitely greater from the use of cocaine than from the use of coca. Notwithstanding this fact it is often prescribed internally.

Samayoa prescribed it in small medicinal doses internally for the treatment of smallpox, and made the following observations, which, if true, are
important:

DEPRESSANTS USED TO INDUCE ANZSTHESIA 189

‘*Cocaine, given continuously from the beginning, can completely abort
the disease.

“*If given after the eruption has appeared, it will transform the confluent
or hemorrhagic forms into the discrete.

**Sometimes when the cocaine is given from the beginning of the disease
the eruption assumes a corneal aspect, and the pustules collapse before the
usual time.

__.*‘Cocaine prevents suppuration, hence there is no secondary fever and no
pitting.

“*To obtain these results it is necessary to give the cocaine as soon as the
initial symptoms appear, and it must be continued without interruption.”

The best preparation is the hydrochlorate, and it should be continued
five or six days, and even nine if necessary.

EUCAINE.

Comprising two preparations placed upon the market: Eucaine A and

Eucaine B, intended as a substitute for Cocaine.
jynonyms—Eucaine A. (Methylbenzoyl tetramethyl oxypiperidin carboniec acid methylether.) Eucaine B. (Benzoyl vinyl diaceton alkamine.)

Only the latter is now used for local anesthesia.

It has marked anesthetic properties. It is more of an irritant, as it induces a local hyperemia, instead of the local capillary contraction and anemia
induced by cocaine.

The agent is applied in two, four and ten per cent solutions, extemporaneously prescribed as ten, twenty or forty-eight grains to an ounce of distilled
water. It is somewhat slower in action, and its influence remains longer than
that of cocaine. It is used in the eye, in the nose and throat, and for all purposes where cocaine is advised.

MENTHOL.

Formula—C,,H,, (HO).

Physiological Action—Menthol is said to paralyze the spinal nerve centers, and also the motor and sensory nerve trunks. Its influence upon the
terminal nerve filaments is immediate and pronounced, producing a local
anesthesia. It produces a sharp, burning sensation followed by coldness and
local insensibility. It is also antiseptic. It is a popular headache remedy and
relieves many cases of simple neuralgia. The crystals are compressed into
the form of pencils, which are frequently rubbed over the painful locality.

Therapy—In simple neuralgia, in toothache, in various headaches not of
organic origin, it will relieve the pain and permit rest and quiet. It has been
of service in severe loca] neuralgia, sciatica and rheumatic pains.

About three grains of menthol every three hours in chronic persistent
neuralgic pains will serve an excellent purpose. If menthol be vaporized in
an atomizer, it frequently relieves asthmatic breathing. It is incorporated
in many liniments where an antiseptic and anesthetic influence is desired.

It is a standard remedy among rhinologists for the treatment of nose and
throat disorders, serving a most excellent purpose in catarrh either of an
acute or chronic character. In acute coryza its frequent inhalation will sometimes quickly terminate all unpleasant symptoms. In hay fever it allays the

immediate discomfort and retards the progress of the disease by its continued
use. In asthmatic breathing of this disorder its inhalation gives satisfactory relief. In fact, any asthmatic breathing may be temporarily benefited
by its use with only pleasant results.

Irritable bronchial coughs and laryngeal irritations are also relieved by
its inhalation. A spray used with compressed air, and deeply inhaled, produces direct and most satisfactory results in all these conditions named.

It is valuable to allay itching and local irritation, especially pruritus
vulvae, persistent cases yielding to its influence. In the itching of eczema
and urticaria and other skin disorders it is of service. It may be incorporated
into an ointment for application.

In the early treatment of carbuncles twenty grains of menthol crystals

may be rubbed up with an ounce of ointment base, and this thoroughly rubbed.

into the swelling and applied over the inflamed area every twelve hours.
The abortive influence of this is pronounced.

Dr. Hill, of Indiana, dissolves menthol in chloroform, and applies it in all
forms of insect bites. It prevents infection.

NOVOCAIN.

Novocain occurs in colorless crystals. It is soluble in one part of water,
and may be boiled without chemical change. It is found on the market in
tablets, from which the percentage solutions can be readily made.

This substance similar in its action to that of cocaine, is a depressant
as cocaine is and as reliable in its influence as a local anesthetic, but is not
quite so irritating in its influence. It paralyzes the sensory nerves. It is
much less toxic than cocaine, and is productive of the same active local influences. Many who previously used cocaine are now using novocaine because
of the greater safety.

Used in the nose from a one to five per cent solution is sufficiently strong,
and in the throat from five to ten per cent is found to be sufficient. It had
not been used internally enough to determine its influence when so taken.

impossible to give it by the stomach. Ergotine in solution in water and glycerine, is excellent for hypodermic administration.

Physiological Action—Ergot causes both acute and chronic poisoning
when taken in toxic doses. Acute ergotism is characterized by vomiting,
purging, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, slowing of the pulse, dilatation of
the pupils, dyspnea, pain in the chest and loins, confusion of the senses, formication, coldness, anesthesia, convulsions, swelling of the face. Chronic ergotism is characterized by neuralgic pains, formication and numbness of the
extremities, opisthotonos, violent delirium succeeded by exhaustion, death
occurring in coma or in convulsions; or the drug may affect nutrition; muscular weakness is followed by gangrene of the limbs or superficial parts,
which become blackened, shriveled and hard—a dry gangrene, generally ending fatally. '

Ergot is classed as a motor excitant by most writers, and yet the evidences, as above described, of its depressing influence upon the nervous system and upon the circulation are most conspicuous. In its influence upon
the circulation of the brain and spinal cord, it may be given in sufficient
doses to produce anemia, and that it does greatly reduce the excitability
of the nervous system, under certain circumstances, none will deny. It acts
in perfect harmony with the bromides when there is acute cerebral engorgement with great nervous excitability.

There is no doubt that it produces contraction of the arterioles, although
there are many evidences to prove that it may permit the venous capillaries
to dilate freely.

In its influence upon unstriped muscular fiber the action of ergot is pronounced. It acts upon the muscular structure of the womb, producing extreme tonic or tetanic spasm of the fibrille, causing a marked reduction in the
size of the organ if enlarged, and rapid emptying of its blood vessels, and
consequent anemia. Many prominent writers believe the anemia induced,
causes the profound muscular contraction. It is more plainly apparent that
& peculiar irritating influence of the agent upon such muscular structure induces its contraction, and that such contraction, assisted by the influence
of the agent upon the coats of the arterioles, causes them to become emptied
to a marked extent, and thus the anemia.

Ergot acts upon the heart muscle in much the same manner as upon
the muscular structure of the womb, although much less violently. It will
surely reduce the size of a hypertrophied or dilated heart.

Because of the profound irritation of muscular fibrille and consequent
almost immediate contraction induced by Ergot, it is a most active agent in
inducing expulsive pains in labor, in overcoming uterine inertia and in controlling uterine hemorrhage.

Specific Symptomatology—Extreme fullness of the circulation of the
brain, flushed face, headache, bright, sharp eyes, great restlessness.

The indications for its safe use in labor are: first, uterine inertia; muscular relaxation with a more or less general weakness; second, the first stage
of labor must be completed, and the ostium vaginae must be fully dilated.

There must be no obstacle to the free expulsion of the child.

The contractions induced by this agent are not smooth, spontaneous,
natural, rhythmical contractions, but are irregular and extreme, and if an
overdose be given it may induce a tetanic contraction and a single, most violent, continuous expulsive effort which does not cease until the entire contents of the womb are expelled.

With such an influence, if there be a rigid, undilated os or perineum, or
mal-position of the child, or extreme dryness of the parts, serious results,


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 129

142 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

as rupture of the womb or extreme laceration of the perineum, are almost
unavoidable.

This profound and continuous pressure on the child and placenta arrests
hematosis, greatly paralyzes the heart’s action, and thus impairs the circulation, inducing cyanosis and often death of the infant before its expulsion
is complete.

Again, such pronounced action upon the womb structure may result in
subsequent muscular paralysis, with great impairment of its contractile power,
and if there be no post-partum hemorrhage there may be subinvolution more
or less persistent. It will be seen, therefore, that this remedy in parturition
is a dangerous one, and if used at all it should be used only when every contraindication is absent, and every indication present.

Therapy—In labor, when there is threatened post-partum hemorrhage,
or when the history of previous labors shows a tendency to such an accident,
a full dose of ergot may be given just at the close of the second stage, or
after the head has passed the perincum. No harm can come from such a procedure, and it will serve as a positive safeguard. If there is then free hemorrhage and lack of full uterine contraction, the dose may be repeated in
perhaps half an hour, but the attendant must be assured that the womb is
entirely empty. If the contractions are not firm and continuous, and hemorrhage at all violent should occur, other measures, such as external irritation
and compression of the uterine fundus, or the introduction of hot water into
the uterine cavity, must be resorted to in addition. Ergot is in general
use in post-partum hemorrhage. It must be given in doses of from half a
dram to a dram of the fluid extract. If this dose be added to an ounce or two
of hot water and drunk, its influence is more immediate and pronounced.

In uterine hemorrhage at the menstrual epoch, menorrhagia, or in metrorrhagia, it is a most valuable agent.

In patients of relaxed muscular fiber its action is very prompt. The
dose can be so measured and timed as to reduce the flow to normal time and
quantity, while by the use of other agents, a healthy condition is being secured. Its influence upon the womb structure is at the same time conducive to
a sure acting in harmony with other uterine tonics.

In the treatment of uterine subinvolution or of chronic metritis, ergot
is a good remedy. The use of the agent conjointly with the bromide of potassium is especially advised in this condition, and with the further administration of properly selected uterine tonics the cure can be speedily comleted.

P Polypi are expelled from the uterine cavity by ergot, and the agent having
a specific action upon the substance of the womb, is opposed to hypertrophy
and to the development of abnormal growths within that structure. Uterine
fibroids are expelled by ergot if possible, and if impossible, the persistent
internal use of the agent is advised as a means of limiting their growth. Interstitial or submucous fibroids only, are influenced by it. Sub-peritoneal
fibroids are apt to be a little outside of its influence, because outside of the
range of the contraction of the muscular fibers.

Mammary tumors, from uterine irritation, are slowly reduced by the
action of ergot.

The hemorrhage and excessive discharges, purulent or otherwise, occasioned by the growth of foreign bodies about the womb, will be beneficially influenced by this agent. The growth of a uterine cancer is sometimes retarded
a little, and the hemorrhage from the cancer is more or less controlled by
ergot.

Dr. Standlee said that ergot would support the patient’s heart exceedingly well when the remedy was indicated, especially when there was muscu-

lar fatigue from overwork or from dyscrasia, as in the malarial infections as
found in the south, or in malignant malarial hematuria, especially if used
hypodermically.

Ergotin so used will control hemorrhage from the lungs. It was administered for this purpose to a drunkard suffering from delirium tremens where
it controlled both conditions satisfactorily.

As stated in its physiological action, ergot is a most useful remedy where
there is a constant tendency to fullness of the circulation of the brain-hypergmia, with flushed condition of the face, with vertigo, nausea, and violent
headache. In threatened apoplexy in young, full-blooded, active men, with
full cerebral circulation, it overcomes the immediate symptoms of an attack,
and if properly administered will cure the tendency.

Where apoplexy from acute cerebral hemorrhage has occurred, it is a
very useful agent in unloading the distention of the capillaries and assisting in the contraction and removal of the clot.

In children, where there has been a fall upon the head, or a violent blow,
with symptoms of concussion of the brain, ergot is the most prompt remedy
known. It should be given in from five to ten drop doses, and repeated in
half an hour if necessary. Spasm should be averted by passiflora, chloral,
the bromides, or, a full dose of gelsemium may be given. But the circulation
of the brain must be controlled at once by ergot and its influence sustained
by smaller doses until inflammation is no longer pending.

In certain forms of inflammation of the brain and its meninges, where the
capillary circulation is very full, ergot is most pronounced and certain in
its action.

In cerebro-spinal meningitis of an acute endemic or epidemic form, it
may be given in the early stages of the attack, but should be withheld in
the latter stages. Other directly indicated agents should not, however, be
neglected for this. It is especially applicable to children in the early stages
of acute cerebral or cerebro-spinal inflammation.:

Ergot in doses of five drops three or four times daily for a few days
will benefit many severe cases of typhoid fever, especially if there be an engorged condition of the cerebral circulation, with tendency to dullness, stupor
and mild delirium, with high temperature. It directly influences the intestinal
canal, overcoming the relaxed and paralytic condition of its muscular structure, correcting diarrhea, controlling hemorrhage and improving the circulaaa] An occasional dose of fifteen or twenty minims will sometimes do much
good.

In the treatment of both passive and active hemorrhage, ergot is a most
excellent remedy. It contracts the walls of the arterioles, shutting off a full
supply of blood and immediately restraining the flow from open vessels.
It is thus at once useful in hemoptysis, in hemorrhage from the mouth, gums,
throat or pharynx, and from the stomach and intestinal canal. A local astringent in gastric hemorrhage from ulcer is often better, and also in intestinal
hemorrhage in typhoid. It is good practice to give a local styptic alternately
with ergot, where there is a persistent tendency to hemorrhage in these cases.

In hemophilia ergot is recommended. In this condition in infants it
may be used for a short time locally and internally.

Hemorrhages about the eye-ball are controlled from its local application, and acute conjunctivitis and phlyctenular ophthalmia will be benefited,
if it be used locally and internally in small quantities.

Occasional large doses of ergot in the treatment of pneumonia are spoken
of as highly beneficial by excellent authorities. The remedy exercises its influence upon the capillaries.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 131

144 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

In hemoptysis ergot is prompt and efficient. It need not be given in
large doses, Three to five drops, four times daily, will usually restrain the
tendency to hemorrhage, and in a free discharge of blood, a ten-drop dose
is usually sufficient, or it may be repeated.

In hematuria ergot is a prompt remedy if from traumatism, or if from
active congestion, but gallic acid is usually better in passive conditions, and
in conditions due to structural change.

In paralysis of the walls of the bladder after retention of urine, causing
over-distention, ergot serves a good purpose. If hemorrhage be present it is
quickly controlled and the muscular atonicity of the walls is greatly benefited.

Ergot is given in urinary incontinence when the cystic walls are greatly
relaxed, or when there is a mild form of local paralysis.

Ergotin i in full doses has quite a prompt influence upon diabetes insipidus.
It is also useful in diabetes mellitus, but is not depended upon alone. In children afflicted with the latter disease it may be given in positive doses for a
time, but should not be given continuously.

In that form of spermatorrhea where there is a tendency to fullness of
the circulation of the parts, with erratic and spasmodic erections, and undue sexual excitement, the emissions quickly occurring after erection, there is
no better remedy known than ergot. It should be given in about twenty
drop doses at bedtime, and its influence is increased and a soothing influence
aa nervous system induced by giving it with ten grains of the sodium

romide.

In the treatment of aneurism, and of enlarged veins, and of varicocele,
ergot is much used. Its influence is more positive though upon the arterial
than upon the venous coats. It is used with good results in hemorrhoids.
Bartholow and others injected it into the dorsum of the penis to contract
the veins there and overcome impotency.

MACROTYS. MACROTYS RACEMOSA.

Synonyms—Black Cohosh, Cimicifuga Racemosa. -

ConstITUENTS—Macrotin, a resinoid volatile oil, tannic acid, gallie acid,
gum, starch, fat, sugar.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Cimicifuge Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Cimicifuga. Dose, five to thirty minims.

Tinctura Cimicifuge, Tincture of Cimicifuga. Dose, one-half to one dram.

Specific Med. Macrotys. Dose, one-tenth to ten minims.

Macrotin or Cimicifugin, which possesses all the medicinal properties
of the root, is a resinous powder of a dark-brown or yellowish color, a bitter,
acrid taste, and slight odor. Dose, one-half to three grains.

Physiological Action—Macrotys in large doses produces general relaxation, dimness of vision, dizziness, tremors, slowing of the pulse, fall of arterial
pressure, vomiting or gastric irritation; it stimulates expectoration and perspiration, causes intense headache and prostration. These phenomena are
caused by the action of the drug on the vasomotor centers and the cardiac
ganglia. The headache is chiefly frontal; in some persons the drug causes
pain in the joints and limbs similar to rheumatism.

The agent is certainly an efficient nerve sedative, although its most pronounced action is on the unstriped muscles. It acts in very many cases where
these muscles are involved, with general nervous irritation, in an immediate


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 132

SEDATIVES ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN DISEASES OF WOMEN 145

and positive manner. In such cases if the nerve irritation is dominant, its
efficiency is greatly increased by combining it with gelsemium.

An overdose is promptly signalled by the appearance of the characteristic headache, which assumes a bursting, tearing character, with injected
conjunctive and flushed face. This will abate at once upon discontinuance
of the agent.

Specific Symptomatology—Muscular aching, local and general, aching
pains as from overworked, overstrained muscles, great muscular aching with
chilliness and rapidly increasing temperature.

It is the agent for hysteria with flushed face and heat in the head, with
restless and nervous excitement and general muscular aching.

Therapy—In the premonitory stage of acute fevers, or of acute inflammatory troubles of whatever character, a common symptom is a general tired
feeling with aching of the muscles. In these cases there is usually a chill
or chilliness, with more or less fever with the aching. One drop of the tincture of macrotys every hour will relieve this aching in from six to twelve
hours. If given with aconite for the fever and belladonna for the rigors, the
time may be reduced to three or four hours. When indicated, its influence
upon the nervous system will probably abridge many of the other symptoms.

Through its influence upon the vasomotor centers and upon the nerve
ganglia, it has a beneficial influence upon the heart. In rheumatic carditis or
pericarditis it is a sovereign remedy acting directly in the line of its physiological influence. In neuralgia of the heart—angina pectoris and functional
irregularity of the heart from exalted nerve influence, either alone or combined with gelsemium, it is prompt and reliable, and should be by no means
neglected.

Prof. King advised this agent in coughs, and its value through its influence upon the nerve centers has been confirmed by many practitioners. It
soothes the cough of excessive nerve irritation, and the reflex cough; the irritable cough of acute bronchitis is relieved by it, as it increases bronchial secretions to a notable extent.

A homeopathic writer says that in pleurisy, there are often strong indications for marcrotys where it works in harmony with aconite and bryonia.
This is our own experience.

It is given by many as a stomachic tonic, and it improves digestion by
relieving excess of nerve influence over the functional operations of the digestive apparatus.

As a remedy for chorea it has become widely popular. Given in fifteendrop doses of the tincture four or five times daily, it is superior to any other
known remedy. Its effects are permanent if the anemia and other concomitant
conditions are correctly controlled by proper medication at the same time.
Its sedative, tonic and antispasmodic influences are here fully exercised.

It may be combined with scutellaria lateriflora, with valerian or gelsemium, as the indications demand, with superb results. The writer has cured
intractable cases by alternating it with minute doses of exalgine.

The characteristic aching pains above described are very constant in
acute rheumatism and rheumatic fevers. Macrotys is certainly a royal remedy
in these cases, and has become universally popular. If the condition be absolutely confined to the joint and does not involve muscular structure, it is
not of as much value. The direct indications must be present.

The agent, however, has a specific influence in overcoming lithemia, and
in preventing and curing conditions resulting from an excess of uric acid—
conditions existing in the uric acid diathesis. It is therefore of value with
auxiliary treatment in acute or subacute rheumatic arthritis with lithemia.

It will be found indicated in rheumatic neuralgia, in sciatica, in muscular
rheumatism of the chest walls, in achings of the deep muscles of the back, in
myalgia, in severe colds, in neuralgia from cold, in rheumatic headache, and
in neuralgia of the ovaries; also with women in the intense muscular aching
preceding the menses.

Macrotys operates directly upon the reproductive functions. In the female it is valuable as above indicated, in dysmenorrhea of a congestive character always, and in amenorrhea. In these cases aconite will aid its action
greatly, if the condition be induced by sudden cold; and pulsatilla will do
likewise if the conditions be caused by nervous shock or functional irregularity extending over a longer period. Helonias may be given with it, if there be
weight and dragging in the lower abdominal region. If leucorrhea be present with the above indications, it is especially valuable. It is valuable to promote uterine contractions, and in subinvolution. In the aggravating rheumatic pains of parturition, or of the later stages of pregnancy, which deceive
by closely simulating those of labor in some ladies of rheumatic diathesis,
this is positive and prompt.

In hysterical conditions of the menstrual epoch, in hypochrondriasis or
melancholia at these times, with congestive dysmenorrhea with the above indications, it is specific. In puerperal hysteria with great nervous excitement
and the above conditions, or with excitable mania or incipient puerperal insanity, it is a most efficient ‘remedy, having a desirable sedatve influence on
the nerves of the womb.

The agent is excellent in relieving irregular pains and uterine distress
occurring during the course of pregnancy. It may be given in small doses,
and it thus prepares the patient for parturition and undoubtedly contributes
largely to a short, easy and uncomplicated labor. The agent, either as the
fluid extract, or from two to five grains of the resinoid, is a most efficient
partus accelerator. It increases the expulsive pains in a regularly intermittent and normal maner, without spasmodic irritation. While the normal pains
are increased, all erratic, rheumatic, irregular and nagging pains are relieved.
It promotes uterine involution and hastens normal recovery.

Knox observed the action of this remedy as a partus preparator in a hundred and sixty cases. His observations, summed up, are that the remedy has
a positive sedative influence upon the parturient woman, quieting reflex irritability, nausea, pruritis and insomnia. It has a positive anti-spasmodic effect,
correcting neuralgic cramps, and irregular pains of the first stage of labor,
sometimes terminating the labor precipitately, if given in too large doses, often
without prodomic symptoms.

It relieves undue irritation of the uterine muscular fiber, relaxes the soft
parts of the parturient canal, and thus facilitates labor and diminishes the
risks of laceration by controlling undue irritability of the muscular fiber.

It maintains a better contraction of the uterus after delivery, but for this
purpose he administers a special dose of thirty minims of the fluid extract
after the birth of the fetal head. It was his habit in using this remedy for
its preparatory effects, to give fifteen minims, at the time of retiring each night,
for six weeks prior to confinement..

In six cases where Dr. Coffin used this remedy for the above purpose,
there was postpartem hemorrhage, and this caused the doctor to question
whether or not the agent had such a relaxing influence, as he was not in the
habit of giving either this or any other remedy to anticipate such hemorrhage. Others deny this influence. I have never observed it.

Webster claims to have observed a case of epilepsy, attended with
amenorrhea which was kept under control with macrotys in conjunction with
the bromides, when the bromides alone had previously failed.

The elder Adolphus, treated ophthalmia with this remedy, especially when
there was severe pain. He gave it in from two to five drop doses, every four
hours, day and night. He claimed that in one severe epidemic it did not fail
to cure. In the severe cases, he applied it externally, as well as administering it internally. In those cases where there was much nervous irritability,
he combined it with gelsemium, which he was confident enhanced its influence.

The agent has been advised in the treatment of smallpox. One of the
old writers claimed that he used it persistently through an entire epidemic,
and the results caused him to entertain the highest confidence in this remedy.
He believed he had aborted the disease in many cases, in forty-eight hours.
If given with the appearance of the premonitory symptoms, the disease was
so abridged, that no eruptions appeared. He usually gave it in the form
of a decoction, in conjunction with equal parts of asclepias, and a small quantity of ginger. He gave enough of the remedy, to induce the physiological
influence, such as aching in the muscles and pain in the head. The agent
should have a further trial in this disease, as others have claimed to obtain
results similar to those quoted above, and the influence of the remedy should
be confirmed or disproved.

In the male it is valuable in gonorrhea, with aching in the bladder and
across the kidneys. We prescribe it oftener than any other agent in these
cases. It soothes the nervous irritability and materially assists in relieving the active inflammation. We usually find indications for aconite in the
acute cases, or gelsemium where there is irritation with a tendency to spasmodic stricture, or hydrangea where there are sharp, cutting pains in urination; and these properly combined have been our ‘‘sure cure’’ treatment
for many years, with mild injections of zinc sulphate, hydrastine, or hydrogen peroxide, all warm, or of warm water alone. It is valuable also in orchitis
with its own indications. In spermatorrhea with irritability and considerable sexual weakness and plethora, it will cure when other agents fail, if
given in half-dram doses after meals.

ARNICA. ARNICA MONTANA.

Synonyms—Leopard’s Bane.

ConstITUENTS—Volatile oil, acrid resin, and a nauseous bitter substance,
resembling cytisin, with gallic acid. A small quantity of an alkaloid called
arnicin.

PREPARATIONS—The tincture of arnica is a common preparation. It is in
common use for external application. It may be given internally in doses of
from one to ten minims. Specific arnica, dose from one-half to five minims.

Physiological Action—The whole plant has a disagreeable, strong and
irritating odor when fresh. The taste is bitter, acrid and permanent. In suffcient dose it causes vomiting and catharsis. It is also diuretic, diaphoretic
and emmenagogue. In poisonous doses, it causes a burning sensation in the
stomach, intense headache, and violent nervous disturbance, with marked abdominal pain. The pulse is reduced and often fails. There may be convulsions of a bilateral character, and ultimate death.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent is specific to bruised, sore, lacerated, confused, muscular structure. It may be applied diluted externally and
should be used internally for the same purpose.

These symptoms may be present from disease, deep muscular soreness—
tenderness on pressure in deep muscular structures. In advanced disease,
where these symptoms are present with marked general enfeeblement, im-

pairment of innervation, with weak circulation, with a tendency towards
permanent prostration, the remedy is specifically indicated.

When there is muscular pain and soreness, which is increased by musoo movement, or soreness in the back, as if from strain, the remedy is
useful.

Where there is inflammation of any organ, with general diffused muscular soreness, the agent in small doses is indicated. Where there is inflammation of any organ from traumatic causes—severe injury to the parts, this
remedy must be given.

In the muscular soreness, pain, and general physical discomfort that follows confinement, especially after difficult labor, this agent used both externally and internally will produce immediate benefits. Internally from fifteen to thirty drops in four ounces of water, a teaspoonful every hour will
quickly relieve the muscular soreness or extreme lameness from the severe
protracted muscular strain. Externally one part to five of warm water may
be applied on compresses over the lame parts, and as soon as soreness of
the breasts occur it may be applied over the breasts for a time.

Therapy—lIn small doses, arnica causes increased perspiration, increased
secretion of urine, and an accelerated pulse. Its tonic influence upon the
nervous system, and directly upon the heart and circulatory organs, make
it a useful remedy indeed. In adynamic fevers, we have so few remedies
possessing sedative properties, which do not depress, that each should be
studied in this line, and arnica is especially available. It must be given in
small doses frequently repeated, in the line of its indications. The indications for bryonia, rhus tox, or belladonna, or perhaps cactus, may be present at the same time.

Arnica is selected for internal use when there has been a severe injury,
with fever, or in surgical fever, where there has been shock and general prostration. In all cases after severe cutting operations, where there has been
destruction of muscular tissue, soreness follows and pain, which is ameliorated
to an excellent advantage by the internal use of small doses of arnica.

In low fevers, where the nervous system is greatly at fault, it not only
controls the temperature, but increases the nerve power, overcoming depression and debility, especially in severe, protracted fevers where the exhaustion results from loss of nerve force and where there is marked depression; if
there be excessive night sweat, colloquative diarrhea, incontinence of urine
or feces, feeble respiratory power where difficulty of breathing keeps the patient awake. It may be given in conjunction with other specifically indicated
remedies to excellent advantage, where there is low muttering delirium,
where the tongue is dry and where the mouth and throat seem to be clogged
with foul, stringy mucus.

When there are typhoid conditions present, with inflammation of the
respiratory organs, the influence of this agent is much like phosphorous,
stimulating the respiration and encouraging the oxygen carrying power of
the blood. Many of the milder forms of acute, or chronic paralysis, are benefited by this remedy.

It is useful in those forms where mania or delirium tremens are present.

In any case where it is indicated externally, it may be given internally
at the same time. Its influence is greatly enhanced.

Soreness in the small of the back, lame back, general weakness of the
muscles of the back, with soreness prevailing, sickening backache in the
region of the kidneys, are all benefited by arnica. It not only relieves the
soreness and the bruised conditions, when given internally, but quickly overcomes the ecchymosis.

SEDATIVES ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN DISEASES OF WOMEN 149

As an external application, to cuts, bruises, lacerations, and sores, arnica
has long been a popular domestic remedy. It is used in full strength, but the
best results are not so attained. It is more serviceable when diluted with
from one to six parts of warm water. It is a stimulant to the skin, promoting absorption of nutritive material. It undoubtedly assists in carrying
off the broken down tissue, which results from the traumatism, and promotes rapid repair. I have observed its influence to be greatly facilitated
by combining it with a nutritional substance. In cases where the muscles
beneath the skin were severely lacerated, torn and bruised, I have applied
one part of arnica with five parts of warm fresh sweet milk, keeping the
application warm, covered with a protective dressing, and renewed every
two or three hours. It is incredible how rapidly the restoration will take
place under these circumstances.

In debilitated conditions, where there are old sores of long standing or
cold abscesses, this agent may be applied in conjunction with bovinine and
will accomplish excellent results.

It is desirable ‘that the agent should be studied more thoroughly, in the
line of its internal use, in surgical fevers with shock, and in conjunction with
external applications after general bruising and laceration, and in extreme
cases of ad;

When there are palette sore spots in the muscular structures of

the body—hyperesthetic areas—without apparent cause, this agent is indicated.
PULSATILLA. ANEMONE PULSATILLA.

Synonyms—Pasque-flower; meadow-anemone; wind flower.
¢ PreparaTIonS—Extractum Pulsatille Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Pulsatilla.
Dose, from one-half to two minims. Precipitates upon addition to water.
Extractum Pulsatille, Extract of Pulsatilla. Dose, one-sixth of a grain.. _Tinctura Pulsatille, Tincture of Pulsatilla. Dose, from five to thirty

Specific Pulsatille, Specific Pulsatilla. Dose, from five to twenty drops in
four ounces of water. Teaspoonful every two hours.

Anemonin. A crystallizable camphoraceous body; volatile, easily converted in the presence of alkalies into anemonic acid. Dose, from one-twentieth to one-fourth of a grain.

The medicinal properties must be extracted from the fresh herb, as the
volatile character of anemonin permits of the rapid dissipation of these properties on drying.

Physiological Action—The agent has a direct influence upon the brain and
spinal cord. In toxic doses it produces mental hebetude, dilated pupils, coma,
and in extreme cases, convulsions. It lessens general sensibility.

It paralyzes to a mild degree both sensation and motion. It increases, in
proper doses, the cerebral functions and imparts tone to the sympathetic system.

In toxic doses it is a heart depressant; it lowers arterial tension, reduces
the pulse rate and temperature.

It exercises an influence upon the heart similar to that of cactus, increasing its power, improving the strength and rate of the pulse and slowing the
rapid and feeble pulse of nervous prostration.

The influence of full doses of pulsatilla, taken into the stomach and intestinal canal, is that of an irritant. In the mouth it acts like aconite or xanthoxy-

## Page 137

150 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

lum, producing tingling, burning and subsequent numbness. It produces a sensation of rawness, and is followed by acid eructations and unpleasant taste. It
produces tightness and constriction of the chest, with congestion, chilliness and
great weakness. The agent is seldom given in sufficient doses to produce the
physiological effects. It operates much more satisfactorily in doses too small
to produce such action. It has long been popular with the homeopathists in
minute doses.

In studying its medicinal influence on the circulation, pulsatilla is said to
act in much the same manner as aconite during fevers, where there are high
nervous manifestations. It equalizes the circulation somewhat like belladonna
it is thought. Where catarrhal disorders are present, subacute in character
with congestion and a free discharge of thick bland, yellow or yellowish green
mucous, it seems to act directly, except in chronic catarrhal conditions. This
remedy will act satisfactorily only when the precise indications for which it
should be prescribed, are present.

Specific Symptomatology—Homeopathic physicians declare fearfulness as
an indication, anticipation and dread of calamity, fear of trouble or death; in
male patients suffering from sexual excesses, with spermatorrhoea, threatened
impotency, prostatorrhoea, with fear of approaching imbecility. We find it
indicated in amenorrhoea, with mental perturbation, great apprehension of
trouble. Spermatorrhoea, with fear of dire results. The remedy is especially
efficacious when existing disorders of the reproductive organs are a cause
of extreme anxiety.

In addition to the well known indication, I might say that it is of value
in disorders of the reproductive organs which depend upon defective innervation, and which are usually accompanied with manifestations of hysteria or
melancholia, or which depend upon sexual derangements and menstrual disorders which are accompanied with loss of strength, chilliness, more or less
headache, and gastric derangements, such as nausea, eructation of sour water
and other nervous manifestations.

Its best influence is exercised in women of blond temperament, particularly of lax muscular fiber, and of mild and yielding disposition, and smaller
doses with these patients will produce better results than larger doses with
other patients. Some writers claim that it may be given during the progress of
inflammation of the mucous membranes, prescribed in much the same manner
as aconite would be prescribed, or as cactus is given.

It acts best in the catarrhal stage of inflammation rather than in the
initial stage, and in this it differs somewhat from aconite.

Therapy—lIts influence is especially directed to that portion of the sympathetic nervous system influencing the reproductive organs. It increases the
tone and functional power of these organs, and overcomes irregular, imperfect
or deficient action.

It is prescribed in uterine disorders which induce melancholia and hysteria.

It has an apparent antispasmodic or nerve-soothing influence, which
renders it valuable in hysteria and general nervous irritation with convulsive
phenomena, in the absence of acute inflammation, blood determination or fever.
A few physicians laud it highly in hysterical convulsions and in convulsive conditions due to uterine disorders.

In general nervousness due to chronic uterine disorder, with or without
hysteria, with despondency and nervous irritation, pulsatilla is an excellent
remedy. It may be given in doses of one drop, frequently repeated. In deficient, suppressed and irregular menstruation, with the above symptoms, it is
of rare value. It will quickly promote a normal and regular flow.

It is an excellent agent in small, frequent doses when the mental conditions
above named are present during pregnancy, with a general relaxed and atonic

## Page 138

SEDATIVES ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN DISEASES OF WOMEN 161

condition. Its influence in these cases is enhanced by combination or alternation with macrotys. It certainly improves the general condition and conduces
to a normal and easy labor.

It is needed during the pregnant state to correct hysterical manifestations
and urinary irregularities. It acts better in the catarrhal stage of inflammation rather, than in the initial stage.

In nervous exhaustion, with feeble pulse and deficient capillary circulation, cold extremities and a generally relaxed physicial condition, it will serve
an excellent purpose combined with other nerve tonics, or in conjunction with
the directly indicated remedies.

Dr. Strauss adds two drams to two ounces of water, and gives a teaspoonful every hour in his irritable cases, especially in low forms of headache, light
and dull; restlessness, patient rolling and tossing until worn out; a rambling
mind with an occipital headache; mild ovaritis; mild neuralgia with irritation of the brain; dragging headache frequently occurring in women.

Pulsatilla is a remedy for nervous headaches, especially if of the anemic
variety, characterized by pallor of the countenance—the headaches of the menstrual epoch, of pregnancy, and also those of gastric origin with this specific
character. It relieves the constipation, enuresis and dysuria of hysteria and
pregnancy. It is excellent for the urinary irregularities of the pregnant condition, with ammoniacal urine, catarrh, pain, tenesmus, burning or sharp shooting pains. Its influence in this is facilitated by hydrangea, gelsemium or the
benzoate or salicylate of lithium.

Where there are menstrual disorders of any kind, if there be loss of
strength, chilliness, headache, gastric derangements, sour stomach, and melancholia, pulsatilla is directly indicated.

Leucorrheal discharges, attended with pain in the loins, weariness, depression of spirits, loss of appetite and general derangement of the nervous system,
are also satisfactorily relieved by pulsatilla taken internally in five-drop doses
of the tincture three times a day, and continued for a few weeks.

Pulsatilla has been frequently suggested in the treatment of phlebitis. Its
indications should be looked for. Dr. Halbert of Nashville gives pulsatilla
for the eye complications of diabetes. He finds it a reliable remedy although
he does not explain its action.

Our observers in many cases combine pulsatilla with heart remedies and
nux for heart trouble, and nervous weakness, especially if there be despondency, or with the alkaline salts in acid stomach. The combinations work very
good results if correctly made.

Homeopathists advise pulsatilla in catarrh of the stomach where the
patient suffers most when the food is taken, or where the most benefit is derived from taking the food cold. Dr. Huffman prescribed it for the mental
symptoms in a patient suffering from chronic catarrh of the stomach. The
tongue was heavily coated. It was dark-brown in the center. The tip and
edges were red; there was fullness and pain always after eating. Sometimes
there was vomiting of the meals. There was a large quantity of mucus in the
vomit. This was followed by a burning sensation from an excess of acids.

This case was not permanently benefited by the ordinary treatment. The
administration of pulsatilla and echinacea before meals finally completed the
cure. Pulsatilla was given in large doses, from eight to twenty minims.

Another writer cured the excessive acidity of these cases with five-drop
doses of passiflora, every two hours.

It is given in bronchial and pulmonary irritation and in bronchial asthma.

It is used in eruptive fevers, and in those cases of measles in which the
eruption produces excessive irritation of the post-nasal cavity, throat and
bronchial tubes.

It has been lauded in rheumatism, but any specific influence in this condition is not ascribed to it.

In gonorrheal epididymitis or in gonorrheal orchitis, the agent may be
given with excellent results, especially if there be gleet and stricture. Small
and frequent doses are better than large infrequent doses. It speedily relieves
the pain and nervous excitability. It is advised for internal use for frost bites.

HYPERICUM. HYPERICUM PERFORATUM.

Synonyms—St. Johns Wort, Millepertuis.

ConsTITUENTS—It contains a volatile oil, red coloring principle, pectin and
a resin.

PREPARATIONS—The powder. Dose from one to five grains. The tincture.
Dose from one-half to ten minims. Fluid extract. Dose, from one to five minims.,

Specific Symptomatology—Muscular bruises, deep soreness, painful parts.
A sensation of throbbing in the body, without fever. Burning pain, or deep
soreness in the spine upon pressure, spinal irritation, circumscribed areas of
intense soreness over the spinal cord or ganglia. Concussion, shock or injury to
the spine, lacerated or punctured wounds in any location, accompanied with
great pain.

Therapy—This agent by Homeopathic physicians is considered specifically
adapted to irritation, soreness, or chronic disease accompanied with tenderness
of the spinal column. It is indicated when symptoms of that disease or of general spinal tenderness are present. If accompanied with fever, which is seldom
the case, other indicated remedies should be prescribed. For traumatism of the
spinal column, or nerve centers, Homeopathists use it externally and internally,
in traumatic conditions of the spinal cord, and where there is shock or where
there are contusions or lacerations without shock. They believe that it will
prevent convulsions from spinal injury, and will prevent tetanus from punctured wounds, relieving the pain resulting from injury.

Hypericum in doses of two drops every four hours is suggested as of much
value in the treatment of piles. It may induce headache, or a burning pain in
the lumbar region. It sometimes induces diarrhea, but these symptoms occurring, the remedy may be reduced in quantity or discontinued for a short time,
and then resumed.

Used as a fomentation or ointment it is applied to tumors, caked breasts,
enlarged glands, ecchymosis, bruises, swellings and painful ulcers.

USTILAGO. USTILAGO MAIDIS.

Synonym—Corn Ergot.

PREPARATIONS—Fluid Extract Corn Ergot, miscible with water. Dose, ten
to thirty minims.

- Physiological Action—The ergot of maize or common Indian corn is similar
in its properties and in its physiological action upon the central nervous system
and upon the capillary circulation of these organs, to those of the better known
ergot of rye.

It is, however, not so irritating in its influence, for, while possessing power,
it works in a smooth, even and pleasant, but positive manner. It produces
uterine contractions of a perfectly regular, intermittent and safe character,
thus possessing a great advantage over the rye ergot.

Therapy—It is a useful remedy in uterine inertia as it does not exercise
the irritating influence of the ergot of rye. Its mild influence prevents any pos-

## Page 140

SEDATIVES ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN DISEASES OF WOMEN 158

sible injury to the child, and it possesses a very small percentage of the oil of
ergot, which is supposed to poison the infant. It conduces to normal involution and tonic and permanent subsequent contractions, with no increase, but
rather decrease, of labor pains. It is also an efficient remedy in post-partum
hemorrhage.

The writer has used it to most excellent advantage in metrorrhagia, and
especially in the hemorrhage from cancer of the uterus, holding the entire condition in check for a time relieving the pain.

In the conditions of chronic uterine hemorrhage or other disorder in which
the ergot of rye is indicated for continued use, this agent will serve all the purposes with few of the dangers of the former remedy.

MISTLETOE. VISCUM ALBUM.

Synonym—Viscum flaviscens.

PREPARATIONS—Tinctura Visci Albi, Tincture of Mistletoe. Dose, from five
to sixty minims. Extractum Visci Albi Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Mistletoe.
Dose, from five to forty minims. Specific Mistletoe. Dose, from one to ten
Administration—The remedy has failed because the agent used was inert,
dried and, perhaps, old. The preparations must be made from the green plant,
and the dose must be sufficiently large and frequently repeated. In some cases
it may be necessary to repeat the dose every fifteen minutes.

Physiological Action—Several cases of severe poisoning from eating the
leaves and berries are on record. It produces vomiting, prostration, coma, contraction of the pupil, with muscular spasm. In other cases it produces tenesmus,
bloody stools, convulsions, emesis, catharsis and death.

In its influence both upon the cerebral circulation and upon the womb
and reproductive functions it acts similarly to ergot.

In 1880 Dr. Brodnax of Louisiana experimented with this remedy to determine its action on the final pains in labor in animals, especially with cows.
The results were so satisfactory that he finally used it instead of ergot almost
exclusively.

It has long been known to exercise oxytocic powers. Brodnax believes
that it may be given at almost any stage of the labor without harm.

Specific Symptomatology—It is indicated where there is a flow of blood to
the brain, and frequent headache and flushing of the face. In hysteria, epilepsy and other nervous diseases; in paroxysms of tearing and rending pains,
rheumatic and neuralgic, it is a pain subduer of much power.

With the above conditions it is exceedingly valuable in diseases of women,
in amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea and as an oxytocic. Its influence is, perhaps,
more marked in labor than when prescribed for any other condition.

Therapy—In its action on the womb it is in some particulars superior to
ergot. It is a drug capable of producing intermittent uterine action, as distinguished from the tonic contractions caused by some other oxytocic medicines.

It exerts its full force on the long muscles of the uterus, acting on the
fandus mainly, while the cervix remains soft and uncontracted.

It may be given early in labor to give tone to the contractions; does not
act spasmodically, but steadily and for a long time; it is not followed by any
untoward effect; does not, like ergot, produce hour-glass contractions; has a
tendency to keep the womb contracted after the expulsion of the placenta and

attachments; does not act on the circular muscles of the womb; is a safe
oxytocic, as the effects can be continued for hours with small doses.

Tascher, in 1892, reported the results of his observations of the action
of this agent upon the heart. He became convinced that it was an agent of
undoubted merit. He has used the fluid extract in doses of from twenty to
thirty minims as a remedy for hypertrophy of the heart, with valvular insufficiency, dropsy of the extremities, small weak pulse, dyspnea, and inability of
the patient to rest in a reclining position, and witnessed astonishing relief from
this agent when others failed. Under its use in the above named conditions the
pulse became full, strong and regular, the cardiac dyspnea was arrested, and
the patient able to obtain rest in a reclining position. In some cases, when
given in large doses, it produced marked diaphoresis, increased flow of the
urine and serous discharges from the bowels, results desirable in all cases
where dropsy was associated with the disease, and a combination of therapeutic action not readily obtained in any other cardiac tonic.

Its diaphoretic and cathartic action cannot be relied upon in every case,
but as a cardiac tonic it is most efficient.

A recent writer has used this remedy in the treatment of chorea. He has
treated several cases of long standing and very persistent. He gives five drops
of the fluid extract of this remedy every two hours.

In the treatment of several cases of spasm in children, he has used this
same remedy as an antispasmodic, and has obtained very good results.

In the latter stages of typhoid fever, when the heart’s action is weak, rapid
and irregular, with a tendency to collapse, given in conjunction with strychnia,
the condition of the patient rapidly improves.

This remedy is recommended for the reduction of blood pressure. A high
authority has suggested that one grain of the aqueous extract of this substance be added to ten grains of distilled water and that combined with two
ounces of simple syrup, from one to two teaspoonfuls can be given at a dose
as indicated in that particular patient. This gives one-fifth of a grain of the
extract at a dose, especially recommended where there is arteriosclerosis.

ANTHEMIS ANTHEMIS NOBILIS.

Synonym—Chamomile.

ConstITUENTS—Volatile oil, Anthemene, Antheminic acid, tannin, resin,
wax.
PREPARATIONS—Extractum Anthemidis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Anthemis. Dose, one-half to one dram.

Administration—This agent seems to exercise but little influence in physiological doses. A few drops of the specific anthemis or the German tincture
in a glass of water in teaspoonful doses every few minutes or every hour will
accomplish good results when directly indicated.

Specific Symptomatology—Severe pain in infants, from simple causes, extreme susceptibility to pain, general hyperesthesia, subjective, acute, transient, sharp pains.

The following indications were given in The Medical Century, and can be
relied upon:

There is perpetual hyperesthesia; there is starting and jumping. The child
is cross, wants to be carried; stool apt to be soft and charged with sulphuretted
hydrogen; if there be diarrhea accompanying, the passages will look like the
white of an egg mixed with greens. The gums are liable to be tender. Tooker
says, ‘‘the remedy of all remedies and the one most often called for during the
teething period is chamomile. This remedy is to children what pulsatilla is to
women, a veritable vade mecum.’’

Chamomile, acts mildly on the nervous system to subdue irritability and
on the gastro-intestinal tract to relieve irritation there. It is adapted to the
restless, peevish, irritable, discontented, and impatient infant who insists on
being carried in arms constantly. With these there is usually hepatic tenderness with watery or greenish, slimy discharges, yellowish and white lumps of
undigested curds, the fecal excordiating the external parts. There is often
difficulty and pain in urination, and bloating of the abdomen with flatulence.
It prevents convulsions by relieving the irritation, but has not sufficient antispasmodic effect to control the convulsions. It is adapted to irritation of the
gervous system, and not atony.

The many conditions with the adult woman it is beneficial, especially to
those in the latter months of pregnancy where there are present false pains,
nervous twitching, reflex cough, explosion of irascibility; where there is fretfulness, peevishness, impatience and discontent; where there is morbid
sensitiveness to pain; where there are sudden fits of temper during menstruation with muscular twitchings.

Therapy—This agent in hot infusion is emetic, a stimulating diaphoretic,
and it promotes the menstrual flow when suppressed from cold. It is of little
importance, in the writer’s opinion, as we have so many other agents with
wider and more positive action. In suppression of the secretions from acute
cold it is a useful remedy. If drank during an alcohol sweat or Turkish bath,
its influence is greatly increased. In acute rheumatism it will prove of service,

It is a mild stomachic and general tonic in half-ounce doses of the cold
infusion, and it seems to mildly stimulate digestion.

In acute colic in infants, with nervous excitability and tendency to spasm,
a few drops may be dropped into a half glass of water and a teaspoonful given
every ten minutes with immediate relief. In flatulent colic and in colic accompanying diarrhea, the discharges of a greenish, feculent character with reflex
nervous irritation or increased nervous susceptibility, it is a specific remedy.

In constant worry and fretfulness of very young infants, without apparent
cause, it is a soothing remedy of much value. It is excellent during the teething period to allay nervous irritation and soothe pain. In neuralgic pains in
children it is useful.

In hysterical females its therapeutic influence is similar to that of pulsatilla. It soothes general irritation and quiets imaginary pains, especially if
occurring at the menstrual epoch.

It is useful in dysmenorrhea and in mild cases of ovarian neuralgia. In
amenorrhea with intermittent pains, and sensations of appearing menstrual
flow, it is useful. It may be given for the erratic pains and reflex nerve irritations of the last months of pregnancy, the reflex cough and unbearable muscular cramps and twitchings.

MATRICARIA. MATRICARIA CHAMOMILLA.

Synonym—German Chamomile.

While this remedy very closely resembles Anthemis Nobilis or Roman
chamomile, there are several distinguishing features in their actions. At the
same time these are not sharp. All that has been said of Anthemis Nobilis
can be said of this preparation.

Therapy—Matricaria is eonspicuously a child’s Temedy, but not distinctly so, A few drops in half of a glass of water, given every few minutes
in dram doses, will quiet extreme restlessness and irritability. The general
soothing effect is satisfactory. It especially controls certain forms of colic.

Peevish children and those who are continuously fretting, or crying out and
who demand constant care are benefited by this remedy. It influences the
membranes of the gastro-intestinal tract. It is advisable when the patient has
contracted a cold, or when there is general chilliness; when the symptoms of
la grippe in children are present, especially where there is disturbed condition of the digestion, inducing diarrhea, sour eructations or acid vomiting
and colicky pains.

The Homeopathists advise it where there are greenish flocculent particles
in the loose watery feces of a patient with diarrhea. The movements are
slimy or yellowish, with an offensive odor, and are acrid, and produce excoriation of the external parts. With these patients there are often muscular
twitchings and an inclination to spasm. The remedy has a sedative influence in these, but must not always be depended upon for its active antispasmodic effect. It may be given during dentition, and being continued the
irritability can be quite satisfactorily controlled. It is often necessary to give
more active anodyne remedies.

from one to five minims.

Specific Medicine Nux Vomica. Dose, from one-tenth to two minims,

Physiological Action—Nux Vomica and its alkaloid, strychnine, act on the
spinal cord and the medulla oblongata, a non-poisonous dose stimulating, and a
toxic dose paralyzing them. There is contraction of the arterioles, while the
heart is stimulated by a moderate dose.

A poisonous dose causes spasm of the muscles of the chest and prevents
the respiratory act, with resulting asphyxia. According to the quantity taken,
there may be weariness, stiffness in the muscles, soreness and heaviness in the
limbs, stiffness of joints and the muscles of the chest and of the lower jaw.
A larger dose causes violent tetanic convulsions, with brief intermissions, acute
sensibility, and death may result in five minutes and usually within six hours.
There is contraction of the muscles, resembling trismus, with constriction in the
throat, headache, dizziness, with symptoms of asphyxia. There is a leaden
color of the skin; breathing is laborious; the pulse is rapid and fluttering,
pupils dilated, while the face has a staring expression, with an appearance of

right.

The spasms grow less violent as the system becomes exhausted. During
the intermission in the spasms the slightest stimulus will renew them. In some
cases there is pain—a neuralgia of the spinal nerves—when an attack is accompanied with shrieks of pain, or with dizziness, insensibility and convulsions.
Small doses in the corpulent may cause slight creeping sensations in the skin
like electric shocks, with involuntary contraction of muscles, with headache, a
disagreeable sensation in the head and dizziness. The influence of strychnine
upon the great sympathetic is shown in many ways. There is an elevation of
arterial blood pressure, an increased vigor to the heart’s action, increased
action of the sudoriparous glands, with dilatation of the pupils.

In some particulars it resembles the action of electricity in its effect upon
the nervous system. There is often a sensation of tingling, a temporary stimulation, a sensation of increased nerve force, a renewed energy imparted to both
voluntary and involuntary muscles.

Specific Symptomatology—The indications for nux vomica are sallow skin,
a sallow circle around the mouth, yellowness of the conjunctive. A thick yel157

low, pasty coat on the tongue, fullness, soreness or pain in the region of the
liver, suggest the use of nux vomica in medicinal doses. It is also suggested by
colic due to atonicity characterized by abdominal fullness, sharp pain at the umbilicus and a general torpor of the system. These symptoms are more quickly
relieved by small doses of specific nux vomica than by powerful anodynes, and
the relief by this agent is a cure. The indications are directly in the line of its
physiological influence in small doses, especially when there is an impairment
of tone of the gastro-intestinal apparatus, a general or local atonicity of the
digestive organs or organs concerned in these processes.

Therapy—This condition is sometimes induced by reflex influence, apparent in the persistent vomiting of pregnancy, the vomiting or regurgitation
of food present in hysteria, and in the vomiting of phthisis pulmonalig, especially occurring in these latter cases after coughing.

Dr. Perry advises nux vomica, ten drops in four ounces of port wine, giving
a teaspoonful every three or four hours when sea-sickness threatens, or when it
may be anticipated. He believes it is a very reliable remedy. A small quantity
of the mixture may be taken on the tongue every few minutes, sometimes with
better results,

The same atonic condition is present with infantile diarrhea of hot
weather, in cholera infantum, in cholera morbus and in cholera. In the vomiting of these conditions small doses of nux vomica frequently repeated are
specific.

In atonic congestion of the spleen or of the liver, existing from malarial
influences, with whatever disease manifested, this agent is directly indicated.

It stimulates the digestion and increases the appetite. It is one of the very
best, if indeed it is not the best, of our restorative tonics. In all debilitated
conditions, in convalescence from exhausting disease and protracted fevers,
wherever there has been depression or exhaustion of nerve force, it is the

In chronic stomach disorder, with deficient digestive power and general
malnutrition, this agent arouses the nervous system and increases the functional activity of the digestive and assimilative apparatus more satisfactorily
than any other known agent.

Cases of vomiting in pregnancy have been controlled by frequently repeated doses of the tincture of nux vomica, and the weakness of the stomach
in dipsomaniacs with vomiting and anorexia are controlled with the agent,
which is often rendered more efficient by combination with capsicum.

Strychnine.

- Description—This most important of the alkaloids of nux vomica occurs in
the form of colorless prismatic crystals, or as a white crystalline powder. It
is odorless, but intensely bitter. It can be tasted in 750,000 parts of water.
It is permanent in the air, very sparingly soluble in water, soluble in one
hundred and ten parts of aleohol and in seven parts of chloroform. Its salts,
named below, are in more common use than the uncombined alkaloid, largely
because of its insolubility, but it may be given in doses of from one-eightieth
to the one-twentieth or a grain. The more soluble salts are in every way preferable.

Strychnine Sulphate. Dose, from 1-120 to 1-15 of a grain.

Strychnine Nitrate. Dose, from 1-120 to 1-20 of a grain.

Strychnine Phosphate. Dose, 1-180 to 1-80 of a grain.

Strychnine Arseniate. Dose 1-200 to 1-50 of a grain.

SPECIAL NERVE STIMULANTS 159

Specific Symptomatology—In acute heart failure from any prostrating
cause, strychnine is given hypodermically or in conjunction with digitalis. In.
the prostration following any inflammatory disease of a severe and protracted
character this combination is specific, but it seems to be particularly beneficial in the prostration of beginning convalescence after pneumonia, especially
if there has been abscess or other exhausting complications. Often in these
cases there is a tendency to sub-normal temperature and slow pulse; when this
is =a case there are but few remedies that will act as strychnine, and none will
excel it.

Therapy—In impotence due to exhaustion, to relaxation or atony of the
erectile tissue of the sexual apparatus, strychnine in small doses persistently
used is an advantageous remedy. The extract of nux vomica may be given,
but will not work as promptly as the alkaloid. In the incontinence of urine of
the feeble and aged, and in nocturnal enuresis in childhood from atonicity
without local irritation, minute doses of strychnia sulphate will often cure
after repeated failure with other remedies. These facts are especially true in
plethoric and relaxed cases and in inactive patients.

In uterine inertia from exhaustion or lack of nerve force, this agent excels
all others. It increases nerve force, restores the normal contractility of the
uterine muscular fibrille, and increases the power and number of contractions
in a normal manner. It also anticipates and prevents post-partum hemorrhage.
In cases where hemorrhage has previously occurred it should be given in advance and for a short time subsequently to the birth of the child.

The influence of the sulphate or nitrate of strychnia is that of a spinal
stimulant, pure and simple, with the power of augmenting nerve force to a most
desirable extent by increasing the nutrition of the nervous system entire.

Its effects are not alone upon the motor nervous system and voluntary
muscles, but upon the sympathetic nervous system as well. For this influence
it is best administered hypodermically in doses of from the one one-hundredth
to the one-twentieth of a grain.

In paralysis of the aged, without active inflammation, it is of value, especially if injected deeply into the paralyzed muscles. Wherever paralysis occurs,
without inflammatory action, it may be used if there be no structural changes
in the nerve centers.

In the early stage of paralysis where rigidity or muscular spasm is present
the agent is contraindicated. In fact, it is not to be administered in paralysis,
except where absence of central irritation is evidenced by complete relaxation,
flaccidity and perhaps tumidity. The more perfect the relaxation the more
satisfactory the action of the agent. In these cases the agent should be injected
directly into the paralyzed muscles.

In lead poisoning, with wrist drop and other evidence of suspension of
nerve influence, with or without lead colic and constipation, this agent exercises
a direct influence..

The influence of strychnine to relieve, modify or cure alcoholism is now almost universally acknowledged. It has been but a short time that dipsomania
has been considered, as it now is, to be an actual nervous disease of the central
nervous system with concomitant phenomena—a long train of disagreeable or
dangerous symptoms. But since this fact has been recognized, there has been
a universal effort made to discover the most satisfactory method of cure.

In 1891 Yarochewski reported a series of experiments on dogs, conducted
to determine the antagonistic power of strychnia over alcohol. He gave them
alcohol of a strength of 42 to 65 per cent and produced a staggering gait by the
injection of 60 grams and complete intoxication with 90 grams. The alcohol
was given for a week and produced considerable emaciation, followed by death.
If, however, a hypodermic injection of two milligrams of strychnine was


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 147

160 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

administered with each dose of 30 grams of alcohol, the latter could be run up -

to 180 grams without the development of intoxication or symptoms of strychnine poisoning.

On the ground of these experiments the author formulated the following
conclusions: Strychnine suppresses the toxic action of alcohol; it enables persons to ingest large quantities of alcohol for a long time without appreciable
injurious effects on the organs. The increased doses of alcohol which may
be given with impunity, if associated with strychnine, have a limit—i. e., as
soon as the quantity of strychnine necessary to counteract the effects of the
alcohol commences to give rise to toxic symptoms. Strychnine is applicable
as an antidote in all forms of alcoholism.

Portugalow, of Samaria, reported in 1891 that he cured 455 cases of
dipsomania with hypodermic injections of strychnine nitrate. He knew of reliable and specific remedies for two affections only: strychnine for the various
forms of alcoholism and quinine for malarial fever.:

He prescribed a solution of the nitrate, two grains to the ounce of distilled
water, for subcutaneous injection. He gave one or two injections daily
of from four to eight minims of the solution. Usually ten to sixteen injections
sufficed for a complete cure. This agent has now become of first importance
in the cure of this condition.:

Baines investigated the action of the nitrate of strychnine in surgical
shock. In thirty cases he injected the remedy hypodermically in one-thirtieth
grain doses for from two to six days previous to the operation, where its general influence was not contraindicated by irritation of the nerve centers. On
the day preceding the operation it was injected every three hours. It was
injected before beginning the operation every two hours, and for two or three
days afterward. In some of the cases he claimed an entire absence of shock.
In all others the shock was very mild, and in no case was it severe, and convalescence was short and satisfactory. In all cases there was no collapse from
the anesthesia, and but little reduction of the force and strength of the heart
and no respiratory failure.

Hare adviscs one-twentieth of a grain of the sulphate of strychnia at the
time of the operation, just preceding and subsequently every half hour, treating the conditions induced by the agent symptomatically. We believe it to
be better to begin earlier, in order to have the system previously braced and
not be obliged to administer the agent to toxicity just at the time.

It is a direct antidote to chloral and is used to great advantage in the
earlier stages of opium poisoning, poisoning or asphyxia from gas inhalation
and chloroform narcosis, and as a restorative to those apparently drowned.

Antidotes—In the treatment of strychnine poisoning, the stomach should
be immediately irrigated. The spasms should be met promptly with inhalations
of chloroform or amy] nitrate. A strong infusion of white oak bark or tannic
acid in water should be given, or the substances can be used in the irrigating
fluid. After the stomach is thoroughly evacuated, chloral in doses of from fifteen to thirty grains, with as much sodium bromide, may be given, or passiflora
in from two to four dram doses, or large doses of the fluid extract of gelsemium.
We have assurance now that full hypodermic doses, thirty to sixty minims of
subculoid lobelia, repeated as needed, will prove to be a most dependable
antidote for the action of this agent..

If the patient cannot swallow, the passiflora or chloral in solution may be
injected into the rectum, or veratrum may be injected hypodermically in doses
of from ten to fifteen minims. If the spasms increase in severity and in frequency, the result will be fatal. If they decrease in severity, are of shorter
duration and occur after increasing intervals, the prognosis is hopeful.

Strychnine Phosphate.

Therapy—The phosphate of strychnine given in doses of from one-onehundred and sixtieth to the one-eightieth of a grain combines the stimulating
properties of the strychnine with the nerve building properties of the phosphorus. It is a combination that should be of much value in conditions where
it is desired to retain the high point gained by a nerve stimulant, and make the
condition thus gained permanent. The use of phosphorus and the phosphates
during pregnancy, where anemia is present or where the nervous system is
seriously drawn upon by the nutrition of the fetus, has been observed by many.
The use of the phosphate of strychnine in doses of one one-hundredth of a
grain is commented upon by Dorset. (Annals of Gynecology, Nov., 1897.)

He says a good appetite and a good assimilation are obtained in the general weakness and debility of the anemic; constipation is relieved, and, in
short, the patient is built up and placed in a good condition to pass through
the ordeal of labor. It improves the appetite and digestion, overcomes despondency, relieves constipation and materially builds the patient up, placing
her in an excellent condition to pass through the labor with full strength. The
uterus contracts promptly after the second and third stages, and the use of
ergot is entirely dispensed with. The often observed chilliness or rigors
which, in the majority of cases immediately follow labor, have been noticed in
but few cases. These rigors, little account of which can be found in textbooks, are nothing more or less than surgical shock. This is obviated by the
prophylactic—strychnine. He believes that as phosphorus and strychnine are
remedies used in the treatment of rachitis with good results they are indicated
during the gestation of the rachitic fetus.

A wide field of action is open to this compound, as prostration from real
deficiency of the nerve elements, prominent among which is phosphorus, is a
common condition among very many, especially among brain workers. The
strychnia lifts the forces up to the normal point, and the phosphorus permanently holds them there by its restorative influence.

Strychnine Arsenate.

Administration—The dose is from the 1-200 to 1-80 of a grain, usually
administered in pill form.

In granules of the 1-120 of a grain the agent is convenient of administration and prompt in its action.

Specific Symptomatology—Hale says arsenic acts upon the glandular system and fluids of the body, while strychnine acts upon the nervous system.
He advises it where the nutritive and glandular systems are involved to any
great extent, with implication of the nervous system at the same time. This is
found in paresis or mild forms of paralysis with edemic tissues, sodden, relaxed
muscular structures, with anemia and tendency to dropsical conditions; great
nervous weakness or prostration, with marked blood dyscrasia, chronic glandular induration, chronic ulceration, and the conditions of the mucous surfaces
of the intestinal canal following typhus or typhoid fever and dysentery.

It is specifically indicated in the debility or nerve failure of the aged, and
in the prostrating influence of severe disease in children. During severe fevers
it will not antagonize the sedative influence of the antipyretics, but will brace
the nervous system against the prostration that will follow when the fever
is gone.

It antagonizes vasomotor paralysis in all cases. In spasmodic affections it
is valuable. The author has given it persistently with sedative remedies in

severe chronic cases of asthmatic bronchitis, especially in the aged, and cured
them both permanently. It is indicated in a general way where strychnine is
demanded, but has a special characteristic tonic influence.

It may be given in the asthenic stage of all prostrating diseases, except
during the hours of the day when the temperature is increasing or stationary
at its highest point. It strengthens the heart’s action, and, like quinine, if
given in the intermission of the temperature, or at the time of the greatest
remission, it often prevents an increase of the fever and determines a continued
lower temperature. It increases or intensifies the action of many stimulating,
restorative or antiperiodic remedies.

IGNATIA AMARA. STRYOHNOS IGNATIA.

Synonym—Bean of St. Ignatius.

ConstITvENTs—Strychnine, brucine.

PrepaRATIONS—Specific Medicine Ignatia. Dose, from one-sixth to onehalf minim. Prescribed from five to fifteen drops in four ounces of water, a
teaspoonful every two hours. Fluid Extract of Ignatia. Dose, from one to ten
minims. Tincture of Ignatia. Dose, from five to twelve minims,

Physiological Action—The remedy presents the peculiarities of nux vomica
to a great extent. In its therapeutic action it is prescribed under much the
same conditions, but is a milder remedy. It seems to have less nerve irritating
properties and an efficient nerve tonic influence.

Specific Symptomatology—Ignatia is applicable if there is a tendency to
mental disorder, with suffocative hysterical symptoms. Also where there is
present the globus hystericus and nervous headache in feeble women with
sleeplessness. It is applicable at the age of puberty during the establishment
of the menses, also at the menopause, when the characteristic symptoms of
nerve irritation are present. All the nervous symptoms are accompanied with
weakness and general inappetence, where the patient considers her condition
very serious, and her chances of recovery very slight.

Further symptomatology is dragging pains in the lower bowels, colicky
pains with the menstruation, sexual frigidity, sterility, and impotence. Muscular twitchings of the face and eyelids, dullness of hearing depending upon the
general weakness, and burning in the bottoms of the feet.

A prominent writer states that nux vomica and ignatia are not interchangeable, though chemically and botanically similar. Ignatia is primarily a
spinal remedy. It seems to intensify the impressionability of all the senses.
When the excitability is exhibited by anger, vehemence and irascibility, nux
vomica is indicated.

When there is melancholy, with a tendency to weep, ignatia is indicated,
and with the melancholy the patient hides his or her grief and nurses their
sorrows, trying to keep them covered up. The patients sigh and weep, when
alone, are very sensitive and easily irritated, but do not disclose their irritation.
They have but little appetite, have considerable pressure on the top of the
head, and are inclined to renew their grief over causes long passed.

In hysteria, these patients will alternately laugh and cry. The laughing
becomes spasmodic, and there is cramping in the hands and chest. These
cramps may be mistaken for convulsive paroxysms, especially as they may be
followed by unconsciousness. But in these, it will be noticed that the spasms
of the hands will be readily relaxed on pressure or the patient will move the
hand voluntarily. The patient recovers with long-drawn sighs. When the
globus hystericus is alarming in this class of patients, give ignatia.

SPECIAL NERVE STIMULANTS 168

While it relieves all the above symptoms, it will also relieve the hiccough,
the flatulent distention and disorders of the stomach and intestinal tract that
are often present, with the above phenomena. It overcomes the pain of intercostal neuralgia, and the acute pain in the head common to many of these
patients. The remedy has a soothing effect in all cases..

Therapy—Some hysterical women are troubled with aphonia, others with
amenorrhoea and in others the menses are replaced by a severe leuchorrheal
discharge. All these symptoms are benefited by ignatia. These patients are
nearly all out of tone. The remedy is a vitalizer and nerve tonic, a restorer of
nerve function. The patients are anemic, they have cold skin and cold extremities, and flabby inelastic tissues. There is lack of power of mental concentration. The patient is usually very forgetful.

Usually twenty drops of specific ignatia, in four ounces of water, a teaspoonful from four to six times a day will be a sufficient dose.

This agent is especially applicable to hysterical females with nervous
weakness from persistent uterine disorder.

In hysteria the agent is given in small doses where the following specific
conditions are present: Dragging pains in pelvis, dysmenorrhea with uterine
colic, sexual apathy, congestive headache, burning on the soles of the feet,
reduced general strength. It will increase sexual desire.

In nervous depression, from whatever cause, Ignatia in small doses frequently repeated and persisted in will be found an important remedy.

Ignatia is suggested as an excellent remedy for sighing respiration. It
acts upon the central nervous forces like nux vomica.

CAPSICUM. CAPSICUM FASTIGIATUM.

Synonym—Cayenne pepper.

ConstiTvENTs—Capsiacin, Capsicin, volatile oil, resin and fixed oil.

PrepaRATIONS—Extractum Capsici Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Capsicum.
Dose, from five to sixty minims. Oleoresina Capsici, Oleoresin of Capsicum.
Dose, from one to five minims. Emplastrum Capsici, Capsicum plaster. Tinetura Capsici, Tincture of Capsicum. Dose, ten to sixty minims.

Physiological Action—Capsicum is a pure stimulant, both local and general. In large doses it causes vomiting, purging and inflammation of the stomach and bowels, with dizziness, intoxication and feebleness of the nervous
power. Locally applied, it is a powerful rubefacient. It produces rapid capillary determination of the blood to the part, and if taken into the stomach it
promotes its own absorption and thus continues its further influence through
the nerve centers. Belonging as it does to the solanacer, its influence upon
the nerve centers, although insidious and not in all its field of exercise readily
distinguishable, is nevertheless active and most important, demanding its classification among the diffusible cerebral stimulants. It produces an increase of
tone and a marked and comfortable sensation of warmth in the entire system,
re a glow and sensation of increased nerve influence and more active circulation.

The general or systemic influence is better obtained from the tincture or
from the hot infusion, while local stomach or intestinal effects follow promptly
upon the administration of the powder.

Its influence upon the circulation is more marked in its local than its constitutional or central effects, although it does influence general capillary tone.
It increases the action of the heart only in extreme cases and in large doses.
It barely increases the pulse beat, although it materially alters its character
and it does not influence the appreciable temperature.

## Page 151

164- MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Specific Symptomatology—It is directly indicated in general enfeebled
conditions, with impairment of nerve influence. In general atonic conditions,
with relaxation of muscular fiber; in plethoric conditions and lethargic affections, with general impairment of tone, with deficiency of functional force,
energy or activity—in these conditions, because of its local and general effects,
it is markedly different from other stimulants.

The indications are marked nervous depression, tendency to capillary
stasis; dry, harsh tongue, with brown coating; scanty and glutinuous buccal
secretion, tendency to tympanitic distension, cool extremities and gastric uneasiness. Furthermore with quinine in malarial troubles, with small doses
of hydrochloric acid, excellent results have been obtained in of
malarial origin, coming on periodically.

Therapy—lIts influence upon the nervous system is shown by the fact that
in general paresis, and in same cases of paralysis, local and general of central
origin, it has rapidly promoted cures without the use of other agents. In one
case after passive cerebral congestion, it was given in strong infusion, and the
tincture applied to the paralyzed arm and muscles, and restoration of nerve
influence followed in a few days with a generally improved condition, of the
nervous system.

It certainly deserves a more extended use in these cases, because of the
possibility of its being pushed to the extreme without danger of disturbance
of function or structure, or impairment or derangement of any organ. It is a
catevep agent, however used; if concentrated, local irritation should be
avoide

It has long been combined with tonics, stimulants and general restoratives
in seriously impaired nerve tone of the dipsomaniac, with results which were
ascribed to other agents used. It has an influence in these cases which resembles that of strychnine, and yet is quite unlike it although fully as important.

In delirium tremens it produces a sedative influence which results in quiet,
rest, and frequently in deep sleep.

In these cases it is best in hot infusion combined with warm beef-tea or
other hot nutritious liquid food. If its use be continued it will replace the alcohol, and in its satisfaction of the unnatural demands of the stomach, will enable
the patient, with proper adjuvants, to permanently overcome the taste for
liquor. It must be given in conjunction with persistent and concentrated nutrition, and may be combined with hydrastine or strychnine or other nerve stimulants and tonics.

It is also of much service in the treatment of the opium and morphine
habits, and also that of cocaine. It must be pushed to the extreme limit and
any local irritant influence avoided.

In languid and enfeebled states of the stomach, with inactivity of the
peptic and other glands, whatever the cause, it is an immediate and direct
stimulant. In atonic dyspepsia and fiatulent colic, in atonic inactivity of the
liver and other glandular organs which have a part in the stomach and intestinal digestion, its influence is immediate and most important.

It is a common ingredient of pills and laxative granules, and it certainly
improves the capillary circulation and nerve tone of the entire intestinal tract.

In the stage of collapse of prostrating diarrheas and of exhausting fevers
and in cholera, no agent is more efficient. It is useful in yellow fever, in typhus and in some cases of typhoid where there are great relaxation and muscular weakness, where there are slugglishness of the nervous system, torpor
and insensibility, low muttering delirium and tendency to coma.

In relaxed and enfeebled conditions of the pharynx and post-nasal membranes, in engorged sore throats not always accompanied with active inflamma-

tory symptoms, it will sometimes cure when other agents have signally failed.
This is especially true if there be a granular condition, with dark colored membranes, or if there be a purple or discolored hue to the mucous membranes, common in some long continued sore throats. It is a valuable adjuvant in the
treatment of diphtheria and in phlegmonous tonsilitis, with sluggish circulation, and also in the sore throat of scarlet fever. In these cases it may be
used as a gargle and taken internally also. A most serviceable general gargle
is made by combining in strong infusion, capsicum and white oak bark—
quercus alba—and adding to it an active antiseptic, as boric acid or echinacea.
This can be given for sore throats when no opportunity for specific diagnosis
is afforded.

In its general stimulant effect this agent is a valuable one in combination
with quinine in intermittents, and also when the latter agent is given as a
tonic and restorative. They act most harmoniously in conjunction, and the
influence of the quinine is greatly intensified. It is safe to say that one grain
of capsicum, combined with three grains of quinine, will produce better antiperiodic effects than ten grains of quinine would accomplish uncombined in
extreme cases of ague, especially if accompanied with gencral torpor and
inactivity of the liver and of the nervous system, as in malignant intermittents
and pernicious fever.

The old Thompsonian No. 6 is made by combining myrrh two ounces,
capsicum half an ounce, and dilute alcohol two pints. Of this, from five drops
to a dram may be given at a dose, and it produces a most profoundly stimulating influence. It was the main dependence of Samuel Thompson.

The old antispasmodic combination known as the Compound Tincture of
Lobelia and Capsicum, unfailing with many of the old doctors as an antispasmodic and general relaxant, is made of lobelia, capsicum and skunk cabbage root two ounces, alcohol two pints. It may be made extemporaneously by
combining equal parts of the tinctures of the remedies. It is given in from
ten drops to one dram, and was relied upon in all spasmodic affections, including puerperal eclampsia and tetanus. ‘.

Capsicum is advised in chronic parenchymatous nephritis, in pyelonephritis and in pyelitis. Also in spermatorrhea, with general relaxation of muscular fiber and in impotence. It is an aphrodisiac of some power. It may be
combined with phosphorus or nux vomica in the treatment of impotency. It
is eliminated from the system through the medium of the kidneys, which it
stimulates to increased action. It may produce urinary irritation and tenesmus.

It is used somewhat, externally, in the form of plasters, embrocations or
in liniments, but it is rather slow in its action upon the skin and is replaced
by more active agents. It is a valuable agent, however, in the treatment of
chilblains, exceeding other better known remedies.

XANTHOXYLUM. XANTHOXYLUM AMERICANUM.
XANTHOXYLUM CLAVA-HEROULIS.

Synonym—Prickly ash.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Xanthoxyli Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Xanthoxylum. Dose, from half a dram to one dram. Specific Medicine Xanthoxylum. Dose, from five to six minims.

Physiological Action—This agent is a stimulant to the nerve centers, and
through these centers it increases the tonicity and functional activity of the

166 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

different organs. It is diffusible, producing a warm glow throughout the system and nervous tingling, as if a mild current of electricity was being administered..

It has a direct tonic effect upon the heart, and it mildly stimulates the
capillary circulation throughout the entire body, overcoming blood stasis and
congestion. In diseases of an exanthematous character it causes the rash to
appear promptly and prevents its recession. It will sustain the vital forces
through any crises that may occur.

Xanthoxylum in certain lines acts similarly to strychnine; in others
it is superior to strychnine, having a wider action. In its effects on the capillary circulation it resembles belladonna or atropia, without the toxic properties.
It must be well known to be thoroughly appreciated.

Specific Symptomatology—It is a specific when there is lack of tone in
the nervous system—a general torpidity with sluggish circulation; in enervation and relaxation of mucous membranes, with imperfect circulation, or hypersecretion. It is thus valuable in catarrhal conditions of any mucous surface,
as it restores the tone and normal functional activity.

In all conditions of the bowels where tympanites is present it is specific,
quickly relieving this condition. King used it extensively in the cholera epidemic of 1849 with excellent results.

Therapy—lIt is a remedy for catarrhal gastritis. In general atonic conditions of the digestive apparatus, combined with hydrastis canadensis, it has
no superior. It has a powerfully tonic influence upon the stomach and digestion,
and improves the general nutritive functions of the system. Whitford gives it
as a tonic in all conditions of weakness, depending upon malnutrition, accompanied with chronic dyspepsia, especially if catarrhal gastritis be present. The
following is his method of combining the remedy:

R—Powdered hydrastis, two drams; precipitated carbonate of iron, one
dram; tincture of xanthoxylum, one-half ounce; simple elixir, sufficient quantity to make four ounces, Take a teaspoonful after meals and at bedtime. The
writer has used a similar combination, the active constituents in a capsule,
every three hours with most excellent results. This formula is especially
applicable as a restorative after debilitating fevers and after prostrating diarrheas, or after dysentery. It works promptly and satisfactorily with children.
The alkaloid hydrastine may be substituted for the powdered hydrastis, where
prescribed in capsules.

This agent, with the older practitioners, was considered a most valuable
remedy in rheumatism. Its stimulating diaphoretic action, with its restorative
and tonic influence, placed it high in the estimation of many as a remedy in
this condition. It is valuable in combination with such remedies as colchicum
and macrotys.

As an alterative it had a wide use at one time. It was usually combined
with stillingia, yellow dock or phytolacca, and often the iodide or acetate of
potassium was added. It serves an excellent purpose in scrofula, and in some
eases of chronic skin disorder, from disordered blood.

SUMBUL. FERULA SUMBUL.

Synonyms—Sumbulus moschatus. Musk root. Jatamansi.

Constirvents—It contains an aromatic resin, a volatile oil and angelic acid.

PrEPARATIONS—F luid extract, dose ten to sixty minims. Tincture, dose one
to thirty minims.

Therapy—This remedy is a pure, stimulating nerve tonic. It seems to invigorate the nutritive functions of the system. It has been recommended dur-

ing the progress of low fevers, where the nervous system is greatly debilitated,
as in typhus, typhoid and typho-pneumonia. Wherever the nervous system has
received the effect of a protracted prostrating disease, it can be given with
advantage. Murawieff advised it in both acute and chronic pulmonary disease,
through its influence upon the nervous system. Probably it influences the
circulatory and respiratory functions, supporting them under the strain of
protracted inflammation. The remedy has been used in stomach disease,
diarrhoea, in dysentery, and in cholera. When the nervous system is enfeebled
in hysteria, and in delirium tremens, it is a good remedy. In chlorosis,
anemia, with nervous phenomena, in leucorrhea and gleet, it is to be advised.

THE ALCOHOLS.

Alcohols chemically considered, are a class of substances of organic origin,
known as hydrocarbons, isomeric in character, belonging to a simple homologous series. They are the hydrates of the methyl group of organic radicals.
Those best known and in common use are constructed as follows:

CH,HO. Methylic Alcohol. Synonym: Wood Alcohol.

C,H,HO. Ethylic Alcohol. Synonym: Rectified Spirit of Wine.

C,H,HO. Propylic Alcohol.

Cc, “a, aHO. Butylic Alcohol.

C,H HO. Amylic Alcohol. Synonym: Fusel Oil.

Alcohol.

Alcohol proper, as commonly understood, is the second in the series—

_ Aleohol.
onyms—Spiritus Vini Rectificatus, Rectified Spirit of Wine. Alcohol -
Ethylene Ethylic Aleohol. Ethyl Hydrate. Vinie Alcohol, Spirit of Wine.

Under this head all substances containing alcohol are treated in a general
sense. Specific substances will receive specific mention. The common forms
of alcohol and of spirituous and malt liquors come under the following general or specific heads:

Absolute Alcohol, Dilute Aleohol, Deodorized Alcohol, Whisky. Synonym:
Spiritus Frumenti. Brandy. Synonym: Spiritus Vini Gallici. White Wine.
Synonym: Vinum Album. Sherry Wine. Red Wine. Synonym: Vinum
Rubrum. Port Wine. Run, Gin, Porter, Cider, Kumyss.

Description—Alcohol is a light, colorless, transparent, volatile liquid, with
a sharp irritating taste and a spirituous odor. It is lighter than water, its
specific gravity being only 0.80. It boils at 173 deg. Fah. and will freeze at
203 deg. Fah. It has a great affinity for water, mixing with it in all proportions.

Alcohol is an active solvent, dissolving solids of many kinds—alkaloids,
resins, gums, oils, liquids, gases, etc. It destroys vegetable and animal tissues.

168 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

It preserves animal tissue from decomposition by hardening, condensing and
contracting its structure. It coagulates its albuminoids.

Alcohol Absolutum—Absolute alcohol is the pure alcohol, without water
or other foreign substance. It is rarely obtained. That which is purchased for
absolute alcohol contains at least two per cent of water. Alcohol U. S. P.
contains ninety-four per cent of the absolute.

It has a specific gravity of 0.82. The rectified spirit of wine—spiritus
rectificatus, Br. P., contains eighty-four per cent of the absolute alcohol.

Alcohol Dilutum—Dilute alcohol, U. 8. P., contains fifty-four per cent of
the absolute. This is about the same as the proof spirit of commerce. In its
ere form it is made by combining equal volumes of water and absolute
alcohol.

It is an excellent solvent, dissolving many substances insoluble in water.
Medicinal substances dissolved in alcohol are called tinctures. Gaseous and
volatile substances so dissolved are called spirits.

Alcohol Deodoratum—Deodorized alcohol contains about 92.5 per cent
of alcohol and 7.5 per cent of water. It is free from methyl or amy] alcohol,
other foreign odors or organic impurities.

Physiological Action—Because of its immediate and profound influence
upon animal tissues, alcohol undiluted is not used internally. A small quantity
taken in this form has produced immediate death. It is a powerful irritant
and produces a shock from overstimulation to which the nervous system
speedily succumbs. There are profound muscular relaxation, a sudden fall in
the temperature, and diminished respiration. There is central vaso-motor
paralysis, which influences these functions, with direct depression of the action
of the heart.

In small doses it acts as a prompt and general stimulant to every function of the body. There is an exalted sensation, a feeling of exhilaration, and
a rise in the temperature and pulse rate that is not merely subjective, but
actual and appreciable.

Its direct influence is upon the nervous system. It increases at first the
normal functional operations of the brain, inducing a free flow of thought
and expression, and a clearness and freedom of mental action without depth.
This condition is rapidly increased until the harmony of action is lost and an
extreme or exaggerated condition follows, which soon becomes a pronounced
disorder of mental action, with incoherent and incoordinate irregular action
of the mind and body.

These effects are more pronounced in one not habituated to its use. Its
continued use produces a toleration which often becomes extreme, but it induces a permanently debilitated and diseased condition of the nervous system,
with a long train of symptoms known as alcoholism or dipsomania.

Acute Intoxication—In the first stage there is a want of mental balance,
perversion of intellect, hallucinations, emotional excitement and incoordination.

In the second stage there are dilated pupils, stertorous breathing, more
or less complete insensibility, a condition of coma, slow full pulse, complete
muscular relaxation and great depression of the mental and physical faculties,
with headache, nausea and vomiting. Recovery of the normal functions is in
reverse order of their perversion.

Chronic Alcoholism—In this condition the power to resist fatigue or the
results of injury, or to recuperate from prostrating diseases, is greatly lessened. There is established a gastro-intestinal catarrh of a chronic character,
with dilatation of the stomach often, which results in nausea, vomiting, anorexia and a confirmed dyspepsia. The integrity of the liver, kidneys and heart
become greatly impaired, and fatty degeneration of these organs is common.

ALCOHOLIC AND ANTI-MALARIAL STIMULANTS 169

The nervous system suffers greatly. There are serious lesions of the structure of the spinal cord, brain, and also of the neural structure in its distribution, resulting in faults of vision, neuralgias, paralysis agitans and milder
forms of muscular tremor and muscular incoordination. The heart and circulatory apparatus are seriously involved. There are palpitation, dilatation
with valvular incompetency, and atheroma of the blood vessels. The arterial
tension is so influenced that the functional action of all organs, especially that
of the kidneys, is greatly impaired.

Its continued use fixes a habit or demand upon the individual which is
imperative, and the satisfaction of which induces a mental and moral degradation exceeded by the use of no other agent with the one exception, perhaps,
of cocaine alone.

There is anorexia in many cases, complete dyspepsia and mal-assimilation of food. Ultimately there is atony and permanent dilatation of the stomach. There is disordered liver which in time becomes organic, resulting in
atrophy or hypertrophy, induration, fatty or amyloid degeneration, or at least
extreme torpor with jaundice.

Cancerous conditions and other blood dyscrasias readily find a nidus in
these depraved tissues. Permanent structural intractable kidney change occurs more often with this class of patients than in any other. There is diabetes mellitus, parenchymatous or interstitial nephritis, or amyloid degeneration. It quickly produces alteration of function of the nervous system—a
form of neurasthenia, structural change, and in some cases paralysis and locomotor ataxia and general incoordination.

The most lamentable condition, however, is the paralysis of the will, and
the inevitable moral degradation and intellectual failure, which results finally
in imbecility.

Alcohol interferes with the elimination of carbonic acid, and lessens the
amount of nitrogenous tissue waste in the system. It is impossible to accept
the theory of Wood, that because of the stimulating influence of this agent
upon the digestion of the nitrogenous products, there is better assimilation
and less nitrogenous waste. The nitrogen, if received, must at some time be
eliminated, if not as a food, then certainly as tissue waste. Alcohol, doubtless, interferes with the secretory function of the epithelium of the renal
tubules and also materially alters blood pressure in the kidneys, and thus prevents the elimination of urea which remains in the blood.

Dr. Winfield Scott Hall says: ‘‘Alcohol is an excretion toxic to the organism that produces it. An excretion of this type is also toxic to higher
organisms, and this is the case with alcohol.

“‘Admitting that it is oxidized in the liver and produces heat, and that
it may lead to decrease in the catabolism of carbonaceous foods, the heat produced is not a normal catabolism, but is simply the result of an insufficient
protective oxidation, the toxic action showing in its narcotic effects.

“‘The decreased matabolism of carbonaceous and nitrogenous foods following the ingestion of a narcotic is a universal fact depending on the drug
effect and giving to the oxidized narcotic no significance as a food. Ethyl
alcohol is not a food in the scientific significance of the word.’’

Alcohol is appropriated to a certain extent within the system, the atoms
within its molecule are rearranged or appropriated by different chemical substances in different combinations. This appropriation, however, is not great,
especially in health, but in extreme prostration it is much greater, and there
has seemed to be a gain in weight from its use. It is absorbed to a certain
extent by all absorbents, and is eliminated by the skin, kidneys and lungs. In
confirmed alcoholics the ingestion exceeds the elimination to such an extent,

170 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

that it is found in the fluids of the brain and of the cord, and its odor is perceptible in other fluids and tissues of the body.

When applied to the skin there is a sensation of coolness because of the
rapidity of its evaporation and absorption of heat. If it be retained in contact with the skin and the air excluded it produces heat, irritation, redness
and consequent inflammation.

Its hardening influence on the integument is induced by its ability to coagulate albuminoids, abstract water and dissolve fats.

Therapy—aAlcohol is introduced into the system through the medium of
wines, brandy, whisky, beers, etc., as the diluted alcohol is not used to any
extent as a beverage. In its therapeutic range the field is an important one,
although many of the very best known physicians—Dr. N. S. Davis and others
—helieve that it is not needed as a medical agent, but can be substituted to
even a better advantage by agents which do not induce the alcohol habit. We
believe that it is entirely unnecessary to prescribe as tonics or restoratives,
wines, beer or any alcoholic beverages, or the alcoholic beverages under fashionable names, as malt tonics manufactured by brewers, or the fashionable
tipple—beef, iron and wine. It will act as follows, but can be readily substituted.

As an emergency remedy, alcohol, as an immediate stimulant, exercises
an important function. In heart failure from sudden shock, in acute prostration of any character evidenced by weak heart, slow pulse and failing respiration, it is used. In asphyxia, either from the inhalation of noxious gases, or
from the use of anesthetics or from drowning, hypodermics of brandy or
whisky will enforce the heart’s action, restore respiration and improve the
general condition. It is of common use in shock after surgical operations, but
is best used in conjunction with heart supporters and strychnine. It is given
preceding the administration of anesthetics to prevent shock. It promotes the
action of the anesthetic. In poisoning with depressing agents of a non-caustic
or non-irritating character, and in the bites of venomous snakes and insects,
it is of value and has been in common use.

With the aged and feeble, in the convalescence of prostrating diseases
of all characters, and especially after inflammation of the lungs, the agent was
in the past in common use as a restorative. It is a stimulant to the digestion
and to the secretion of the digestive ferments. Its influence upon absorption
and nutrition is not, we think, as desirable as that of other tonics non-alcoholic in character.

As a restorative to adynamic conditions it is given to best advantage in
conjunction with concentrated nutritious foods, as in egg-nog, with eggs and
milk, with albuminoids, and with beef juices and meat extracts.

In some cases of prostration with distress and even pain, great restlessness and wakefulness, small, frequent doses, by building up the forces temporarily more nearly to the normal point, produce quiet restfulness and promote sleep. In cerebral anemia its influence in temporarily re-enforcing the
cerebral circulation will promote sleep, but the results of the sleep usually
are not rest and are unsatisfactory.

Alcohol, externally, is an antiseptic. It is especially useful in suppurating wounds, and especially in preventing and curing bed sores. It is cleansing
and stimulating, and promotes granulating and healing. In preparing for
surgical operations it is used in full strength as an application to the skin to

- render it aseptic in the field of the operation.

In bruised and swollen parts, in inflamed joints and glands, it serves a
good purpose. It hardens the skin and contracts the tissue, promoting healing by resolution and preventing abrasion, ulceration or suppuration.

It is prescribed in vomiting from atony, in the vomiting of pregnancy, in
seasickness and in the vomiting of extreme prostration. It is even thought

ALCOHOLIC AND ANTI-MALARIAL STIMULANTS 171

necessary to administer it to allay the uncontrollable vomiting of delirium
tremens. It is advised in disorders of the stomach and bowels, in atonic,
gastric and intestinal indigestion.

An excellent use for alcohol is in the sudden hoarseness or croupal cough
of children, as an external application, mixed with an equal part of water and
kept moist and warm. It is surprising how quickly the child will breathe
more easily, and the hoarseness will have disappeared. It is of immediate
benefit in sudden attacks of the croup.

During the past few years much use has been made of hypodermic injections of alcohol into the structure surrounding cancer and malignant growths,
and into the immediate substance of the growth itself, with the result that
iri many cases the abnormal growth has at least been retarded and in some
cases removed. The method is considered one worthy of trial in a certain
class of cases.

Wines and Malt Products.

Therapy—While wines are consumed in all civilized countries, they are
seriously detrimental to health. They induce plethora, gout, lithemia and
apoplexy, dropsy, unsteady nerves and enfeebled and disordered mental
action. In the consideration of wines as medicinal agents, their action is
fully covered under the subject of alcohol, as their medicinal effect in the
main is due to the amount of alcohol they contain. It is true, however, that
there is considerable difference in the action of different wines. They have
more of a sedative influence upon the stomach, and probably possess greater
nutritive properties. They are less stimulating than the liquors, but containing a larger quantity of sugar, their free ingestion induces greater disHa of the stomach, and is apt in some cases to produce constipation and
‘ever.

In their application, however, to specific disease conditions, they must
be adapted with regard to the percentage of alcoholic strength, and with consideration to the percentage of nutritive properties.

Beer, ale and porter are malt products, and as stomachic tonics, as restorative agents, especially in pulmonary diseases, as stimulating nutritive agents
for administration during recovery from protracted illness, they are considered as of much value.

CINCHONA. CINCHONA CALISAYA.

Synonyms—Peruvian bark.

ConstTITUENTS—Quinine, Quinidine, Cinchonine, Chinchonidine, Quinamine,
tannic acid; thirty-two natural and eight artificial alkaloids, resinoid, volatile
oil, gum, sugar and wax.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Cinchone, Extract of Cinchona. Dose, one to
five grains. Extractum Cinchone Fliudum, Fluid Extract of Cinchona. Dose,
ten to sixty minims. Specific Medicine Cinchona. Dose, one to thirty minims.

Quinine.

The pure alkaloids of cinchona are not employed in medicine, but their
salts, formed from acid and basic combinations, are in common use.

In the consideration of the therapeutic properties of the various alkaloids
of cinchona there is but little difference observed in their action. There is
almost no influence exercised by any one of them that is not exercised to

an equal extent by quinine, and except where otherwise specified, the Sulphate
of Quinine is the agent here considered.

Quinine Sulphate.

Dose, one to twenty grains.

Physiological Action—In doses of five grains three or four times a day
for a few days, it produces fullness of the capillary circulation of the brain,
throbbing in the head, suffusion of the face, ringing in the ears, with dullness
of hearing, headache, mental confusion and nervous excitement. If the above
doses be given every three hours continuously there is muscular feebleness,
with general impairment of motility, increasing debility, great restlessness,
with wakefulness, dilated pupils and partial loss of sight.

A single dose of sixty grains of quinine sulphate given to an adult male
caused extreme depression, with feeble circulation, coldness of the surface and
extremities, respiration slow and sighing; pulse slow and almost imperceptible,
pupils widely dilated, sight and hearing almost extinct, voice very feeble;
thirst great, tongue pale and moist, breath cold. While in some cases blindness from quinine has continued for some time in no case has it been permanent. Quinine has produced deafness also, which in many cases has been
permanent. In some cases death has followed the administration of the remedy in disease, a result fairly attributed to the drug. In small doses it is tonic,
in large doses stimulant, and in still larger doses sedative, acting on the cerebro-spinal nervous system and through the ganglionic nervous system on the
heart. Besides the above named effects, large and repeated doses may cause
gastric irritation, eructations, chill and fever paroxysms, headache, perspiration, vertigo, staggering and delirium—the condition known as cinchonism.

Specific Symptomatology—Quinine will act favorably upon the system if
the skin be soft, if the mucous membranes of the mouth are moist, and if the
tongue is moist and inclined to clean, if the pulse is full and soft and the temperature declining or at normal. In other words, when the secretory functions of the body are in a working condition, quinine will produce no unpleasant results.

Quinine is specifically an antiperiodic. It will overcome malarial periodicity, especially if the above named conditions are present when the agent
is administered.

It is profoundly tonic; under limited conditions it is antipyretic and also
antiseptic. It has specific oxytocic powers over the parturient uterus.

Quinine destroys the plasmodium malariz readily, even in the minute
quantity of one part to twenty thousand of water. Its influence upon malarial conditions can thus be readily understood.

Therapy—In the administration of quinine as an antiperiodic, the
beneficial influences are not altogether in proportion to the size of the dose.
Enormous doses may abort a chill if given during its course, or during the
course of the fever. They are very likely, however, to increase the nervous erethism and the temperature; whereas, if proper doses be given during the intermission, from one to three hours preceding the anticipated attack, or at the
time when the temperature has reached its lowest point, small doses will accomplish positive results.

In continued fever, with a sufficiently marked remission occurring at a
given time each day, or on each alternate day, the agent should be given
during the remission, provided the temperature declines to a point sufficiently
low to admit of a temporary restoration of the suspended secretions. This
point is usually not above 10014 degrees. If the remission be short, a single

## Page 160

ALCOHOLIC AND ANTI-MALARIAL STIMULANTS 173

dose may be given. As a reqult the temperature does not run quite as high
as on the previous day, and the next remission is more marked and of longer
duration. At this time, perhaps, two full doses, two hours apart, may be
given. The fever is still lower and the remission so marked by the third day
that the agent, in reasonable doses, may be continued through the exacerbation, the temperature at no time, probably, rising above 101 degrees and not
increasing above normal after the third day.

The writer has adopted this course for so many years, with perfectly satisfactory results, that the method is confirmed in his mind as the proper one
in all cases where malaria is the cause.

Where continued fever exists, quinine is of no benefit if there is no
marked remission or other evidence of malaria. It is thus of no use during
the progress of typhus, typhoid and other protracted fevers. In such cases
it causes nerve irritation and increased temperature, especially if there is
deficient secretion.

When the fever is broken and there is a tendency toward a restoration of
secretion, and the temperature is normal or subnormal, then this agent is a
vitally important one. Here the bisulphate, being readily absorbed, produces
the happiest results.

In intermittent fevers it is excellent practice to give the remedy in broken
doses during the intermission. The absorption of the sulphate of quinine
takes place so slowly that a period of between four and six hours is required,
under favorable circumstances, to develop the full effect of the remedy.
dose of from three to five grains, given five hours before the expected
paroxysm, will exercise its full influence upon the paroxysm when it should
appear.

If another dose of two and one-half grains be given two hours after the
first dose, and a third dose of the same size be administered after another
period of two hours, or one hour before the chill will occur, the effect of the
agent will be uniformly continued during the time in which both the chill
and the fever would have reached their highest point. The repetition of this
course on the second and third days will usually be sufficient to overcome
the most severe cases. It is well to adopt the same course on the seventh,
fourteenth and twenty-first days following the attack.

The following formula is of excellent service in those cases in which the
liver and other glandular organs have been profoundly influenced by the
disease, and where the nervous system shows considerable depression:

R—Quinie Sulphat,...................008.
Leptandrin,..... Capsici pulv,............ cee cece gr.

M. Ft. Capsule, see eees

Sig. One capsule in the manner "above specified every two hours until
three are taken. When the paroxysms no longer appear, two or three grains
of quinine may be given regularly every three hours during the day.

In the treatment of congestive chill, and in malignant conditions of malarial origin, quinine is specific, but should be given in much larger doses, and
usually with some direct stimulant and in conjunction with the use of external
heat. It may be given in doses of twenty grains preceding the attack, or with
stimulants during the attack. If a severe attack is fully anticipated, large
doses should be repeated every two or three hours during the entire remission.

As an antipyretic quinine is no longer used. It was once considered of
essential importance in the reduction of high temperatures, but the conditions and character of its action were so imperfectly understood that it often
did harm, and caused an increase in the temperature instead of a reduction.

174 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

In the regular school the coal tar antipyretics have replaced it. With our
own school it has been at no time depended upon to allay fever.

As a restorative after pneumonia, where hepatization has been extensive,
this agent is an important one. Two grains of the bisulphate of quinine, with
one-fourth of a grain of ipecac, and perhaps the one-fourth of a grain of
nux vomica, will rapidly improve the function of the nervous system and of
the circulation, and as rapidly overcome the hepatization and other results
of inflammatory action. The influence upon the stomach and intestinal canal,
ie thus upon the digestion and assimilation of food, is marked and immeiate.

Quinine is a stimulant tonic of great value. Its influence is exercised to
the best possible advantage when there is impaired or deficient nerve forée.

It is indicated as a restorative after prostrating disease, especially after
continued and inflammatory fevers. It strengthens the action of the heart,
improving the character of the circulation of every organ. It arouses the
digestive organs and encourages assimilation and nutrition. It stimulates the
liver and kidneys, and thus assists in the rapid elimination of the waste products of the disease. It stimulates the respiratory function, promoting
oxygenation of the blood, thus assisting in the restoration of the character
of that fluid.

These results are accomplished largely through its profoundly stimulating influence upon the cerebral and spinal centers.

It has been the writer’s custom to use the bisulphate of quinine as a
tonic instead of the sulphate, because of its free solution and rapid absorption. It is milder in its effects upon the nerve centers and fully as efficacious
in its tonic influence. It is combined to excellent advantage with hydrastine,
nux vomica or the salts of iron.

Or it may be given with strychnine or picrotoxin or ignatia with excellent results, and if liver complications exist, it may be combined with leptandrin, podophyllin or iris.

In chronic congestion of the liver, or splenitis, quinine dissolved in the
tincture of the chloride of iron, and combined with syrup of orange or simple
elixir, produces satisfactory results..

In the prostrating night sweats following malarial fever this agent, in
the above combination, is a fine tonic, quickly overcoming the sweating and
other results of the disease.

Where paludal miasm is the cause of various indefinite disorders, or of
general malaise, the phenomena occurring periodically, quinine should be
given to anticipate the unpleasant symptoms. Dumb ague, hemicrania and
severe general headaches, neuralgias of various kinds and asthmatic attacks
occur from this cause and are satisfactorily treated with this remedy. It may
be afterward given as a tonic, in combination with any other tonic agent
which may be specifically indicated.

Quinine has a direct power in inducing contraction of the parturient
womb, especially if from inefficient strength the labor has been prolonged until
the nervous force of the patient is well nigh exhausted. If fifteen grains be
given in one dose, it may overcome all undesirable conditions at once and
prove sufficient. The contractions are normal in frequency and of regular character and force.

It thus overcomes inertia and will prevent post-partum hemorrhage.
It is a good remedy for this latter condition when it has occurred, acting also
as 8 stimulant to the heart and nervous system. It is a dangerous remedy in
large doses during pregnancy, as it may bring on premature labor.

In amenorrhea from cold it is useful and may be prescribed alternately
with aconite, after a hot bath has started secretion from the skin.

ALCOHOLIC AND ANTI-MALARIAL STIMULANTS 175

As a stimulating antiseptic it has been used as a wash in very many
conditions. In sluggish ulcers and old sores, where there is no activity to the
capillary circulation, it may be applied with good results. It is useful in
threatened gangrene and in chilblain. It was at one time extensively used as
a throat wash in diphtheria, and to its antiseptic character is credited its
beneficial influence upon whooping cough, having been much depended on
for the cure of that disease.

A douche made by dissolving six or eight grains in a pint of hot water
will be found of service in chronic catarrh, with fetid discharge, and in hay
fever. In the latter condition, full doses internally, three times a day, will
materially improve its local influence.

In the administration of quinine to children in all but the severest of
malarial conditions, it may be given by inunction, and all of the results of
internal use will be thus obtained. The soft skin of the chest, axille,
abdomen or groins is bathed with hot water and quickly dried, and the ointment immediately applied. From three to five grains of the sulphate is thoroughly rubbed into two drams of lard, and the whole applied during the early
part of a remission or intermission. The course must be repeated on consecutive days for four or five days. If the fever is then broken or the chill
does not occur, the application can be made regularly once in eight or twelve
hours, using less quinine, and continued as a tonic as long as a tonic is
needed. No one will administer. quinine per os to infants who has used
this method successfully.

ALSTONIA. ALSTONIA CONSTRIOTA.

Synonyms—aAustralian fever bark, Bitter bark, Alstonia bark.

ConstTITUENTS—Several analyses have been published, which vary somewhat. Alstonine, an amorphous alkaloid, is present in all. Alstonidine and
porphyrine are also found.

PREPARATIONS—The powdered bark, dose from two to ten grains. The tincture, dose from ten to sixty minims. Specific alstonia from two to twenty

Specific Symptomatology—General malarial cachexia, periodicity, fever

General atony of the glandular organs, with sallow skin, heavily coated tongue
and constipation.

Therapy—This remedy was brought to the notice of the profession by
Dr. John M. Seudder. He regarded it superior in its tonic and restorative
properties to calisaya bark in certain specific conditions. His indications
were as follows: The tongue inclined to be dirty, skin dark and sallow, the
urine depositing a sediment, with a general lack of tone.

ee the above conditions are present from malaria, it is directly indieated.

It is an antiperiodic, when persisted in, in chronic cases, but for immediate effects, in acute cases, it does not replace quinine. Dr. John Fearn
advises it where there are gastro-intestinal disorders, depending upon chronic
malaria, such as atonic dyspepsia, lienteric diarrhea, and dysentery. In these
chronic cases, it will sometimes succeed when quinine fails. It is well to prepare the patient for its use by a hot bath, and a diaphoretic. It is a cerebrospinal stimulant and tonic. It acts directly upon the great sympathetic nervous system and stimulates the vital forces, through the improvement of every
organic function. It improves the blood-making processes and assists in more
perfect elimination by increased tonicity. Dr. King reported the cure of

pungent taste. It is soluble in aleohol and in glacial acetic acid, and should
be kept in dark-colored glass bottle with ground-glass stoppers in a cool place.
The dose is six to ten minims, in a capsule or emulsion, four times daily.

Physiological Action—In overdoses Eucalyptus produces drowsiness
with a loss of muscular power, cold skin, pale lips and cheeks, feeble pulse,
short and irregular breathing and contracted pupils. It produces increased
action of the kidneys, pain in the stomach and bowels, indigestion and diarrhea. It is eliminated through all the emunctories. The inhalation of the
vapor of too large a quantity of the oil has produced the nervous phenomena
above described in children, but this result is rare.

After a moderate dose of the oil of Eucalyptus, in which its chief virtues
reside, there is a feeling of exhilaration and buoyancy, while after very large
doses there is depression, with drowsiness, loss of power in the limbs, skin
pale, cold, insensible; pupils contracted, pulse imperceptible, breathing short,
jerKing and interrupted.

Poisoning by eucalyptus from taking a dram of the oil exhibited the
following symptoms which developed very slowly: There was vomiting, and
abdominal pain, which occurred in about four hours; diarrhea became marked,
and in an hour later the boy became drowsy, semi-comatose, pale, collapsed,
with small pulse, muscles generally relaxed, pupils medium sized and equal
to some response to light; breathing shallow. Other than these the symptoms
resembled opium poisoning, and the coma persisted several hours. There was
an absence of nervous irritation, but the gastro-intestinal symptoms were
marked. The agent seemed to inhibit the influence of the cerebrum. There
was the odor of oil on the breath for three days.

The poisonous effects should be treated with the usual diffusible stimulants strychnia, alcohol and atropine.

Therapy—In therapeutic action this agent closely resembles cinchona.
It is antimalarial, antiperiodic, febrifuge and tonic. The tree has been planted
in malarial sections, and wherever planted the malarial conditions have been
changed, the disease germs destroyed and the atmosphere purified, the locality
becoming healthful and sanitary.

While acting similarly to quinine it may be prescribed where quinine is
contraindicated. Its stimulating and antiperiodic influence is not so immediately marked, but its antimalarial influence is persistent, and satisfactory
results are ultimately obtained, which can be said also of its antiseptic influence.

ALCOHOLIC AND ANTI-MALARIAL STIMULANTS 177

It may be given in low forms of fever where the stimulating influence of
quinine is too great, increasing the fever. In these cases eucalyptus will
reduce the fever.

In the condition known as dumb ague and masked intermittent fever,
it will sometimes accomplish very satisfactory results. In all conditions where
there may be malarial infection, especially where other disease is present
which shows a marked increase at a given time each day, where there is
much malaise and muscular aching or distress of a distinctly periodical character, this agent is directly indicated in doses of one-half dram of the tincture.

It is of much service in malarial neuralgia, in malarial headache and in
vague intermittent conditions of an indefinable character.

Where night sweats follow malarial disorder, where an enlarged liver
and spleen remain after the periodicity is broken, where jaundice has been
a more or less persistent complication, this agent has been of much value, combined with other indicated measures.

The antimalarial and distinctly antiseptic properties of eucalyptus give
it a prominent place in the therapeutics of typhoid fever; while it has many
of the essential tonic and restorative properties, it is most active as an intestinal antiseptic. It has been used in epidemics of typhoid where there could
be no possibility of a mistaken diagnosis, and when given from the first all the
symptoms showed positive amelioration. The temperature especially was
kept under control, while the disease symptoms were markedly controlled. It
has been especially noted by those who have used this agent persistently,
that the attendants are not likely to contract the disease. This is attributed
to the fact that the agent destroys the germ within the intestinal canal.

Eucalyptus is a valuable remedy in scarlet fever given in conjunction or
alternation with aconite and belladonna. It answers an excellent purpose in
many cases. It prevents the symptoms developing in a severe form by destroying the germs and assisting in the control of the temperature. It cures
the throat symptoms quickly. It stimulates a normal action in the glands of
the skin, and by encouraging elimination through these glands, prevents postscarlatinal nephritis. Five drops in lard thoroughly rubbed together and
applied to the skin daily, is one of the most efficient of applications. When
nephritis is present it has a positively curative influence.

In the treatment of diphtheria, eucalyptus is an excellent remedy. It may
be used as a gargle diluted, and when the membrane has formed in the
larnyx or in the nasal passages, if fifteen drops of a mixture of equal parts
of the oil of eucalyptus and turpentine be dropped onto the surface of hot
water in a close-mouthed vessel, and the vapor inhaled by the patient for a
few minutes every two hours, there is nothing that will more speedily destroy
the membrane and assist in its removal.

The writer has been successful in completely clearing the nasal passages within thirty-six hours by this measure when the occlusion was nearly
complete. This course is almost equally applicable in membranous croup. A
specific measure in this disease is to give internally every two hours five drops
of a mixture of equal parts of the tinctures of eucalyptus and jaborandi. If
the membrane has formed extensively, this course loosens it and permits it to
be thrown off. If it is in the early forming stage, the growth ceases and the
membrane disappears. These facts have all been confirmed in a multitude of

Eucalyptus if further used in tonsillitis in chronic post-nasal and bronchial
catarrhs in asthma, in which case the vapor either alone or with that of
stramonium is very useful, and in those conditions of the lungs and bronchi
where there is offensive expectoration, pus or a suggestion of gangrene. In

the constitutional treatment of phthisis it is of value, and if a few drops of the
oil be added to cod liver oil, it will remove the disagreeable flavor of the
latter agent.

This agent has been used with excellent results in the treatment of chronic
ulceration of the stomach. It stimulates the mucous surface to normal action,
destroys the germs of the disease, prevents putrefaction and corrects excessive
acidity..The ulcers heal rapidly under the influence of this remedy. It is
equally efficacious in chronic diarrhea and dysentery with offensive discharges.

The agent has been extensively used in the treatment of catarrh of the
bladder, nephritis, pyelo-nephritis and pyelitis, especially if the urine be decomposed and offensive. It is useful also in gonorrhea and in gleet and as a
wash in specific vaginitis.

In uterine catarrh this agent is valuable used as a douche in the proportion of two drams of the tincture to a pint of water. Whenever offensive
discharges from these parts are present, it is useful in ulceration of the cervix.
It may be made into a suppository with cocoa butter and white wax, in the
proportion of one part of the oil to three parts of the other mixed constituents. This suppository is of great service after labor, either where the
douche cannot be used or to be inserted after the douche where there is traumatism. This suppository is of value in uterine cancer. It relieves pain and
corrects the odor of the discharges.

BONDUC. OZESALPINIA BONDUCELLA.

A new substitute for quinine is brought forward by Keshav Lal J.
Dholakia, Delhi, India, in Practical Medicine. He recommends the powdered
kernels from roasted bonduc nuts. These are derived from a legume-bearing climbing plant, Cesalpinia bonducella, found almost throughout India.

The drug is antiperiodic, febrifuge, tonic and anthelmintic. It is given
in doses of from ten to fifteen grains every four hours. It is described as
closely resembling quinine in action, as harmless to pregnant women, as not
being contraindicated during fever, and as well borne by patients with
quinine idiosyncrasy.

As an anthelmintic the action is weak. The drug is comparatively harmless in large doses.

of Belladonna Leaves. Dose, one quarter to one-half of a grain. Tinctura
Belladonne Foliorum, Tincture of Belladonna Leaves. Dose, from one to
thirty minims. Extractum Belladonne Radicis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of
Belladonna Root. Dose, from one to five minims. Specific Medicine Belladonna. Dose, from one-twentieth to one minim.

Administration—The official fluid preparations in most part of Belladonna vary so much in strength that they cannot be relied upon for activity
as compared with each other. Using the product of a single reliable manufacturer one ultimately learns the strength of that product and is thus able
to adjust it accurately. The normal tincture of The Merrell Company, the
Homeopathic mother tincture, and the specific medicine are all reliable
preparations, but vary greatly in comparative strength. The specific medicine is very active, and I would advise that each prescriber dilute a given
quantity with four parts of alcohol and prescribe this as a strong tincture.
Ten drops of this in a four-ounce mixture given in dram doses will be found
uniformly active for children. A good U.S. P. tincture will answer in many
cases in drop doses in adults.

Physiologic Influence—In its full primary influence, belladonna is an excitant to the cerebrum, promoting active hyperemia—a profoundly full,
active condition of the cerebral capillary circulation. I will show later on
that this influence of dilating the capillaries, combined with the stimulating
influence of the agent upon the heart, with a characteristic influence in contracting the capillaries of the splanchnic area, makes this the most powerful
agent known, in its direct influence upon pathologic hyperemia or a tendency to stagnation in any of the capillaries, whatever organ they may be
distributed to. I will also show that this influence can serve as a guide in
the prescribing of this remedy in a rational manner, more profoundly than
any other influence the remedy exercises.

When given in full doses the fulness of the capillary circulation induced
produces a flushing of the face, a bright redness of the skin, which in sufficient dose is general over the entire body. This resembles very closely the
erythematous rash of scarlet-fever, and from this fact the Homeopathists
have one of their guides in prescribing this agent for that disease. It suppresses the secretions of all the organs, especially of the mucous membranes,
inducing dryness of the throat and mouth and a tendency toward constipaion.

The evidences of cerebral fulness are: restless excitation, mental exhilaration, headache, dilated pupils, intolerance of light, impairment of vision,
uncertainty of muscular movement, the latter finally amounting to incoordination, with motor paralysis. There is delirium of a talkative character, in
some cases violent or furious, with illusions and hallucinations. In extreme
delirious excitement, if the dose is a fatal one, there is feeble pulse, cold skin,
shallow respiration, and paralysis of the inhibitory nerves of the heart and
heart-muscle, resulting in death.

In the influence of this remedy upon the capillaries of the skin, loading
them up so actively, there is a contributory influence upon the capillaries
of the spinal cord, which decreases the amount of blood in this locality, exercising often an exceedingly beneficial influence, especially when the patient
suffering from spinal or cerebral congestion has cold skin, cold extremities,
a cold, clammy sweat, dilated pupils, and great sluggishness of action. In
this case, the remedy is absolutely specific and invariable in its influence.

Belladonna acts directly upon the heart. It is a pure stimulant to this
organ, through its influence on the cardiac muscle and accelerator nerves.
Previously it was thought that this drug increased arterial pressure. This
now is considered doubtful, as positive proof is lacking. Notwithstanding


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 167

180 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

the lack of proof in the laboratory, in the individual there is more force in
the pulse, and there is extreme activity, as stated above, in the capillary circulation, especially when there is profound congestion, with cold relaxed
skin, difficult breathing from pulmonary hyperemia, with a small compressible pulse and a deathlike pallor, followed, in extreme cases, by cyanosis.
Then the stimulating influence of 1-80 or 1-60 of a grain of atropine will
show itself unquestionably in a very few moments. This influence is very
general. Strychnine expends its influence upon the nerve-centers, but the
influence of atropine is upon the peripheries in an unquestionable manner,
making it probably the most active of the diffusible stimulants. In this rapidity in removing the blood from the lung-cells it increases oxidation. It
thus relieves the pulmonary hyperemia, overcomes cyanosis and promotes
free, deep breathing.

Specific Symptomatology—There is a characteristic syndrome present in
congestive types of many diseases which rationally indicates the need for
belladonna. Preliminary congestion is a common condition in very many diseases and the influence of this drug, in antogonizing congestion and in producing a normal and effective equalization of the circulation brings it first
to the mind of those who are studying actual conditions, in an endeavor to
decide upon the needed remedy.

The syndrome referred to consists in chilliness, mental dulness, and inactivity; dull eyes with dilated pupils, eyes partly open when asleep; skin
cool and relaxed, with occasional free sweating; cool extremities; general
sluggish capillary circulation.

The Homeopathists claim that belladonna is especially indicated where
the patients are full-blooded; seldom in anemic patients. Children, very
active and with big brains, who are disturbed nights by night-terrors or
dreams or show other evidences of restlessness are relieved by belladonna.
The remedy acts best in full-blooded patients, where there is active localized
heat, pain, redness, and swelling, evidences of local inflammation. That is
a very common indication—local engorgement. When there are a full, bounding pulse, dull flushed face, dull eyes, dilated pupils, and throbbing carotids,
the remedy is beneficial. Negroes, and those in warm climates, are especially susceptible to the action of belladonna.

Belladonna is not a specific fever-remedy, but in a febrile disorder there
is some local engorgement somewhere; there is local capillary hyperemia and,
if the remedy is not contraindicated by an already too active condition of
the capillary circulation, it will be found of service in all acute congestive
disorders with temperature. I have made it a practice for thirty-five years
to combine this remedy with the directly indicated fever-remedy, until the
symptoms of local engorgement were overcome, then to continue with the
fever-remedy alone. When so prescribed, the influence of the remedy to restrain secretion need not be considered, as this influence is usually antagonized by the agent that is used to control the temperature. This is especially
true of aconite administered in conjunction with it, which makes a most reliable combination.

Therapy—Belladonna is indicated at the onset of inflammatory conditions. Given early with aconite, when fever alone is present, hyperemia does
not occur and the inflammation is aborted. If the disease is localized in any
organ, displaying the phenomena named above, its influence often is quickly
apparent.

In diphtheritis, tonsillitis, croup, bronchitis, pneumonia, pleuritis and
peritonitis, belladonna stimulates the capillary circulation in the engorged
organs, thus quickly preventing the local effects of the acute congestion or
inflammation. At the same time it has a marked influence upon the fever

STIMULANTS WHICH DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE CIRCULATION 181

when used in conjunction with the other indicated measures. In chronio
soreness of the chest, belladonna is a valuable remedy. It is one of our best
remedies in whooping-cough. If half a drop of the tincture of belladonna be
given every two hours, alternated with one grain of alum in syrup, excellent
results often are obtained.

In the therapeutics of all continued fevers this agent has an essential
place in some stage of the fever. In fevers of malarial origin, there is no
other remedy that will replace it. In the sthenic stage of these fevers, combined with aconite, it is sufficient for many of the indications. If there is
an intermission or a marked remission, it may be continued alone during the

eriod.

P In typhoid fever, it is an important auxiliary during almost the entire
duration of the fever. Contraindications may arise, when it must be discontinued. It prevents congestion of the intestinal mucous membrane, and of
the glands. This is indeed, an important function. It stimulates the heart
to diffuse thé blood uniformly throughout the entire capillary circulation,
and thus prevents cerebral engorgement. The brain symptoms exhibit many
of the belladonna indications and are quickly relieved by it. It may not convince the prescriber of its beneficial influence in only a single case, but its
continued use, in many cases, is most convincing, as compared with those in
which it is not used.

In meningeal inflammation, both of adults and children, it is often
sharply indicated. This is especially true in subacute cases, where there is
slowly increasing dulness, with a cold, moist skin, although there is an excess of two or three degrees of temperature. The pupils are dilated widely,
the eyes are dull, the head is drawn back and crowded into the pillow, slowly
and constantly rotated from side to side, the eyes are partly, if not widely,
opened when the patient is asleep, and the urine passes involuntarily. These
cases are sometimes exceedingly stubborn. Belladonna or its alkaloid in frequent doses is the most directly indicated remedy.

In the milder forms of insanity or other forms of mental disease, the
Homeopathist prescribes belladonna where there is violent delirium, with
livid face, dilated pupils, protruding eyes, fury, striking or biting, spitting,
inclination to throw off the clothing or tear them, intolerance of light, extreme arterial tension; but he gives in high dilutions.

One physician says that in certain forms of obesity, with plethora and
an inclination for general stasis, belladonna will assist in reducing the amount
of fat.

Erysipelas will yield promptly to belladonna or atropine in small doses.
It is given with aconite or alternated with rhus. It should not be omitted.
It acts most promptly if the tissues are smooth, dark, and deep-red, with sluggish circulation and burning, the inflammation being confined to the structure of the integument, and not in the areolar tissues, there being no pustulation or vesicles present.

In eruptive fevers, it is a most essential remedy. It quickly determines
the eruption to the skin, and retrocession is almost impossible if it is used
early. If retrocession has occurred, belladonna is the most prompt remedy
known for restoration of the eruption.

In scarlet-fever, it has a salutary influence also upon the fever. It promotes exfoliation and assists in the general elimination of the products of the
disease. It is directly opposed to the renal hyperemia or the nephritis so
common as a result of scarlet-fever and diphtheria, and is our most reliable
remedy with which to overcome this condition when it occurs. For the nephritis, a drop of the tincture may be given to a child ten years of age every
two hours, alternated every hour with 1-2 grain of santonin. If there be a

182 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

large quantity of albumin present, two grains of gallic acid every two hours
will facilitate a cure,

Given in small doses after an infectious exposure and before the occurrence of scarlet-fever this agent will act as a prophylactic of the disease. The
writer has administered the remedy to the other exposed children when a
single case has appeared i in a large family, none of whom had an attack. It
must be given in small doses: ten drops of the tincture of belladonna in four
ounces of water, a teaspoonful every two or three hours to a child of six
years. Some of our. writers have claimed that belladonna is just as effective
in preventing the development of diphtheria and measles as it is in preventing scarlet-fever. They think they have excellent reasons for this conclusion,
and I am inclined to believe with them.

Belladonna is of value in congestive neuralgias. Full doses should be
given. It will cure some exceedingly stubborn cases. It is an excellent plan
to give it with ammonium chloride in stubborn chronic cases.

In prostrating night sweats, with enfeebled circulation and cool relaxed
skin, belladonna or atropine is advised. The 1-100 of a grain of atropine at
bedtime will accomplish excellent results. It may be given hypodermically.
Medicinal doses of belladonna during the day will accomplish similar results.

In headache from fulness of the circulation of the brain dull frontal headache, with indisposition, malaise, and cool skin, with mental torpor and a
tendency to unpleasant dreams, this remedy is of value; 1-2 drop every hour
or two.

The influence of this drug as an antispasmodic against involuntary muscular action gives it some value in spasmodic colic and obstinate constipation. It is in common use in laxative pills, to facilitate the action of the purgatives. In lead-colic, it is advised.

Belladonna in physiological doses is an excellent remedy for the treatment of the conditions present during the passing of biliary calculi. It very
materially facilitates the passage of the stone, prevents chronic change occurring in the structure of the duct, relaxes the duct by a paralyzing effect
upon the circular muscular fibers, and renders subsequent attacks less frequent and less severe.

It is a remedy of service in the treatment of nephritis. Albuminuria is
the result of greatly increased renal blood pressure and capillary engorgement. Belladonna antagonizes all the pathological processes in a direct
manner. In acute cases, its influence is apparent from the first. In subacute
or chronic cases, its use must be persisted in, but the results are equally satisfactory where structural change has not taken place in too great a degree.
Other indicated measures are not to be neglected.

In incontinence of urine, where there is a plethoric tendency, a stagnant
capillary circulation or the tissues are relaxed, belladonna is a prompt remedy. It is useful in diabetes insipidus, with cold extremities. In these cases,
it should be given in full doses.

Professor Whitford long advised belladonna for painful menstruation.
There is an extreme form of this difficulty, in which the patient becomes very
cold; the skin is cold and clammy, the pain is extreme, the hands and feet
are icy cold, and the temperature subnormal. Belladonna in full doses to its
physiological effect is directly indicated here. The patient can be put into
a hot bath, with only good results if this is not overdone, but the equalization of the circulation can be accomplished well with belladonna. Occasionally a hypodermic of atropine will accomplish the results more readily.

By stimulating the capillary circulation in the ovaries this agent is directly useful in the milder forms of congestive dysmenorrhea. The direct indications for the agent are nearly always present in the cool skin, cool ex-

STIMULANTS WHICH DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE CIRCULATION 183

tremities, dulness, chilliness, and inactivity. It may be given in drop-doses
preceding, during or subsequent to the period.

Its influence in stimulating the capillary circulation of the ovaries fn
stasis renders it of value in the treatment of sterility from inactivity of those
organs. If there are hysterical manifestations at the menstrual epoch, with
deficient menstruation, pulsatilla may be used in conjunction with it.

The agent will retard the secretion of milk in the lacteal glands, and is
of service when, from the death of the child or from acute inflammation, as
in severe mastitis, where abscess is threatened, or from other causes, it is necessary to suppress the secretion. It may be given both internally and _applied externally, with good results. Its influence is wide and salutary. When
restoration of the secretion is desired, it should be promptly discontinued.

Externally, belladonna is used in spinal tenderness, with congestion, also
in congestive occipital headaches and lumbago. It is applied in all conditions inducing a lame back and in neuralgia of the spinal and sacral nerves.
In violent acute inflammation, it acts as a sedative and anodyne while it exercises its healing properties. It is used in rheumatism, in sprained and painful joints, and in boils and carbuncles.

The extract of belladonna is used in relaxing a rigid os uteri. An ointment is made and applied directly to the os. In this form, it is of value in
spasmodic-urethral stricture and in painful congestive conditions of the rectum. A prepared belladonna-plaster may be applied over inflamed organs
while the agent is being given internally.

In the treatment of phlebitis, for which we have very few specific remedies, the late Professor Clark, because of its power in overcoming hyperemia
of the venous capillaries and venous walls, claimed that belladonna, in the
form of a strong ointment made from the concentrated extract and kept hot,
would produce very prompt results. He invariably used it, and claimed to
have had no failures. He would watch for the physiological effect—the dryness of the mouth, dilatation of the pupils, and dry throat; he would then
remove it for a while, subsequently to reapply it in the same manner.

Atropine.

Atropine is the essential alkaloid of belladonna. It is difficult to obtain
entirely free from hyoscyamine.

Description—It occurs as a white crystalline body, usually in minute
acicular crystals, or as an amphorous white powder of a bitter, acrid, nauseous taste and odorless. Upon exposure to the air it assumes a yellowish color.
It is soluble in 180 parts of water and three parts of alcohol, fifty parts of
glycerine and quite freely in ether and chloroform.

Atropine Sulphate.

Description—This salt is perhaps more commonly used in medicine than
the unsaturated alkaloid, atropine. It is a white crystalline powder, odorless and permanent. It is freely soluble in water and in alcohol, nearly insoluble in ether and chloroform.

Therapy—The uses of atropine and atropine sulphate are those of belladonna. Their concentrated form greatly increases the violence of their
action. Belladonna is preferable for constant daily prescribing. These alka-

loids are of much advantage in narcotic poisoning and as stimulants in the
recovery of patients from shock. The 1-100 of a grain will produce the
physiological symptoms in a healthy patient. This dose is seldom exceeded.
From 1-150 to 1-200 is usually sufficient. The 1-50 of a grain is the maximum dose. They are best used hypodermically.

Solutions of atropine for hypodermic use should always be made fresh.
Old solutions are to be avoi ied. The fluid becomes infected, and the alkaloid is partly destroyed.

Atropine is used to dilate the pupil in examination of the interior of the
eye, and it is useful in acute inflammation of that organ. It empties the
capillaries of an excess of blood, abating the inflammatory processes. It prevents adhesions in iritis, and assists in breaking up any that may have occurred. Two grains of atropine are dissolved in an ounce of distilled water,
or better yet, in an ounce of castor oil deprived of its ricinic acid. From
one to five drops of these solutions may be instilled into the eye. The oleaginous solution has advantages over the aqueous solution.

Atropine is of superior advantage, used hypodermically, in certain emergencies; in narcotic poisoning, and as a stimulant in the recovery of patients
from shock. The 1-100 grain dose will produce the physiological symptoms
in a healthy patient. This dose seldom is exceeded, and from 1-200 to 1-150
grain usually is sufficient. The 1-50 of a grain is the maximum dose.

Within recent years, the action of atropine given hypodermically for
controlling hemorrhage has gained so many advocates that it has now become
established as a most reliable remedy for that purpose. Doctor Waugh was
* among the first to bring this use of it forward. His arguments have been unanswerable until its position is now fairly established. He clearly demonstrates its rational, reliable influence for this purpose. From 1-50 to 1-100
grain is injected, and the doses repeated as needed. It is exceedingly useful
in uterine hemorrhages.

Doctor Paulding, writing in The Medical Council, relates some experiments with the hypodermic injection of atropine in acute alcoholism. There
were eleven boys less than 12 years old playing in a freight-yard, where some
highwines in barrels were standing on open cars. A barrel was tapped with
a gimlet and through a straw all of the boys drank freely of the spirits. Doctor Paulding was called to treat one of them. He observed the extreme dilatation of the pupils. This is the characteristic indication for atropine, determined its use, and he gave a hypodermic of 1-200 grain. This one dose
saved the boy’s life. The other ten boys died. The doctor reports two other
cases where death seemed imminent, but which were saved by a single hypodermic injection of 1-100 grain of atropine.

Doctor Shadid dissolves 1-60 of a grain of atropine in 2 ounces of water
and gives one teaspoonful every ten minutes until there is relief, in certain
headaches which follow prolonged worry, excessive mental exertion, with
more or less exhaustion.

In acid stomach, where the hypersecretion of the acids is great, atropine,
an occasional dose as needed, has been found to exercise a good influence.

Mild solutions of atropine dropped into the ear will relieve earache.

The use of cactus in subnormal temperatures has strong advocates, but
its influence is positively enhanced by combining it with atropine, giving the
two in comparatively full doses for a time.

The injection of atropine at the constriction, in case of hernia, or the application of the extract of belladonna over the enlarged hernia, has caused
the spontaneous reduction in a number of cases. It is a powerful laxative
in spasmodic or other constrictions.

Atropine has been used with excellent advantage in the treatment of sea688.

HOMATROPINE HYDROBROMATE.

Formula—C,,H,,NO,HBr.

Synonym—Hydrobromate of Homatropine.

Description—in the formation of Homatropine the chemical process consists of the decomposition of the amygdalate of tropine by hydrochloric acid.
The Hydrobromate is a crystalline powder or minute white crystals. Soluble
in six parts of cold water, sparingly soluble in alcohol.

Therapy—tThe agent is not advised for internal administration, although
in doses of 1-20 of a grain it has been given for excessive night sweats. It is
used in the determination of refraction, and in examination, in ophthalmic
practice. Its advantage is in its promptness of action as a mydriatic and its
transient influence. It is used in the strength of four grains of the salt to
an ounce of distilled water. It is in common use for complete paralysis. In
this it is necessary to use a stronger solution—two per cent generally. A
few drops instilled into the eye and repeated a few times, a few minutes
apart, will in a short time accomplish the desired result. The pupil begins
to dilate about ten minutes after it is first introduced. The effects are completely dissipated in the course of about thirty-six hours, while atropine rebree its influence for, perhaps, ten days, and hyoscyamine for six or eight

ays.

The main objection to the use of homatropine is the hyperemia of the
conjunctiva which follows its use. There is seldom, however, any acute inflammation. It does not so readily produce constitutional effects as atropine
if absorbed.

In the treatment of inflammations it is not as serviceable as atropine.
Because of the increased engorgement of blood in the part, it increases the
condition. A further advantage of atropine over this agent in inflammations
is its permanency or persistency of action.

STRAMONIUM. DATURA STRAMONIUM.

Synonyms—Jamestown weed, Jimson weed.

Constirvents—Daturine, which, according to Ladenburg, is a mixture of
atropine and hyoscyamine, stramonin, scopolamine.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Stramonii Seminis, Extract of Stramonium
Seed. Dose, from one-sixth to one-half grain. Unguentum Stramonii,
Stramonium Ointment. Extractum Stramonii Seminis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Stramonium Seed. Dose, from one to five minims. Specific Medicine Stramonium. Dose, one-fourth to ten minims.

Physiological Action—The action of stramonium on man is similar to
that of belladonna. Moderate doses increase the frequency and fullness of
the pulse, with dizziness and perspiration; a larger dose (five grains of the
powdered leaves) causes nausea, thirst, dryness of the throat, difficulty of
speech, dilatation of the pupils, fever, relaxation of the bowels and increase
of urine; a poisonous dose causes delirium, with laughter, loquacity, violent
striking and biting, with grotesque hallucinations.

Daturine acts more powerfully than atropine, though its action is regarded as identical. The resemblance between stramonium and belladonna is
a very close one.

Stramonium is a narcotic poison, a stimulant to the nerve force in its
direct effects, and profoundly so in its influence upon the sympathetic nervous system.

Therapy—tIn proper doses it acts as a sedative and anodyne in a manner similar to hyoscyamus. It is a remedy for excitable mania and acute delirium, with violent uncontrollable tendencies. It has been given in epilepsy
for its soothing and tranquilizing effect, but its antispasmodic influence is
not sufficiently great to place it among the agents for this disorder.

It has been given in neuralgias wherever located, and in neuralgic dysmenorrhea. In hysterical mania, accompanied with convulsions, epileptiform
or other convulsions, it is an excellent remedy. In small doses it will remove
the globus hystericus.

It is credited with controlling the contractions and pain in approaching
miscarriage and abortion, and preventing those accidents.

In the treatment of that condition usually known as milk sickness in
malarial localities, Kipley claims to cure all cases with the freshly bruised
seeds of stramonium, giving as many as from fifteen to thirty seeds every two
hours. To the animals who contract the disease, a teaspoonful of the seeds
is given three or four times daily with satisfactory results.

He also gives it in the painful menstruation of women with good results,
giving fifteen bruised seeds every few minutes until the pain is relieved, then
farther apart.

As an ointment it has been long applied to inflamed swellings and to
glandular inflammations and in painful hemorrhoids. It is useful in mastitis,
orchitis, parotitis, in rheumatic inflammations, and as a fomentation in these
latter conditions, and in pleuritis and peritonitis, using caution not to obtain
too marked cerebral effects.

In muscular tremblings it is indicated, especially if of functional or reflex origin. In the vertigo and unsteadiness from chronic indigestion or disase stomach from hyperacidity and in headache from this eause it is the

In spasmodic or paroxysmal cough, as whooping cough, and in the violent paroxysms of acute bronchial eough, it is a soothing remedy, as it acts
without suppressing secretion as actively as belladonna.

Because of its antispasmodic influence upon spasmodic asthma, it has
come into general use as an agent in that disease, used principally as an inhalant. The dried leaves are burned and the fumes are inhaled and relief
is immediate. The dried root in coarse powder as well as the powdered
leaves may be smoked in a common tobacco pipe.

This use of the agent produces excessive expectoration, and also marked
nervous phenomena, such as vertigo, nausea, determination of blood to the
brain and stupor. In plethorie patients these induced symptoms are sometimes violent and even dangerous. It is sometimes burned in conjunction
with potassium nitrate, to enhance its effects.

DUBOISIA. DUBOISIA MYOPOROIDES.

Synonym—Corkwood Elm.

Constitvents—An alkaloid Duboisine similar to hyoscyamine and atropine. Dose, 1-130 to 1-50 grain, usually administered hypodermically.

PrEPARATIONS—Extractum Duboisie, Extract of Duboisia. Dose, 4% to %
grain. Extractum Duboisie Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Duboisia. Dose, from
two to ten drops.

STIMULANTS WHICH DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE CIRCULATION 187

Physiological Action—Duboisia is similar in many respects in its influence, to stramonium, hyoscyamus and belladonna, It produces dryness in the
mouth and constriction in the throat, with difficult deglutition. It increases
the pulse rate and arterial tension, increases the capillary circulation in the
skin, with flushed face like belladonna. The pupil dilates, there is a sensation of fullness in the head, with tinnitus aurium, vertigo, nervous excitement and muscular uncertainty. These conditions are followed by mental
inactivity and stupor, with general quiet, although the patient may not sleep.

Therapy—The agent has not been extensively used for internal administration. It soothes the respiratory apparatus, increases the action of the
heart, like belladonna in congestions, and is given to control excessive night
sweats.

It has been given in some cases of maniacal excitement, but it must be
given in the enfeebled cases and not when there is fullness—engorgement of
the circulation of the cerebral organs. It has been used in the treatment of
emotional insanity and delirium with excitement. Duboisine is given in doses
of from 1-120 to the 1-60 of a grain in these cases, and is said to be a valuable hypnotic. In a few insane patients, especially those with hysterical
manifestations, it has caused regurgitation of the food. It is also used in
muscular tremblings, paralysis agitans and epilepsy.

There are a few patients who are especially susceptible to its use and
will experience vertigo, fullness of the head, a feeling of danger and heart
pains, even from small doses, or from a single drop of a one per cent solution
in the eye.

Duboisia has been used as a mydriatic. It has no properties not possessed by atropine, although it is elaimed to produce its effects in paralyzing
accommodation and dilating the pupil more rapidly, with less conjunctival
irritation and with more speedy recovery.

_ The hypodermic injection of duboisine will antagonize the influence of
opium or morphine as effectually as atropine.

PHYSOSTIGMA. PHYSOSTIGMA VENENOSUM.

Synonyms—Calabar bean, Ordeal bean, Chop nut.

ConstiTveNTts—Physostigmine or Eserine, Calabarine, Eseridine, Phytosterin.?

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Physostigmatis, Extract of Physostigma. Dose,
from one-twentieth to one-eighth of a grain. Tinctura Physostigmatis, Tineture of Physostigma. Dose, from three to ten minims. Specific Medicine
Physostigma. Dose, from one-fourth of a drop to five drops. Prescribed, from
eight drops to two and one-half drams, in four ounces of water. A teaspoonful every two to four hours.

Physostigmine or Eserine—A crystalline solid, white or pinkish colored,
readily soluble in alcohol, sparingly soluble in water. Dose, 1-150 to 1-20 of a
grain.

Physostigmine Sulphate—A crystalline powder, whitish or yellowish
white, changing on exposure to a pink or reddish color, bitter, odorless, deliquescent; freely soluble in alcohol and water. Kept for preservation in
amber-colored vials. Dose, 1-150 to 1-30 of a grain.

Solutions of one grain of physostigmine or its sulphate to the ounce of
distilled water is used in the eye, one drop three or four times daily.

Physiological Action—The first effect of calabar bean upon internal administration in overdoses is local—a sense of burning and irritation in the
stomach, with nausea, vomiting and purging. The salivary, gastric and in-

testinal secretions are all greatly increased. It stimulates unstriped muscular
fiber, producing in the intestinal canal increased peristalsis. There is inactivity, prostration, cold, pallid skin and muscular incapacity.

The evidences of the action of this agent upon the nervous system are
not marked. No pain is produced and the consciousness of the patient is
usually retained. Probably, from deficient oxygenation of the blood, there
is vertigo, which may finally induce narcosis. There are ultimate paralysis
and temporary tetanic convulsions, There is abolition of motor reflex.

The arterial tension is at first lowered, then increased, the heart is
slowed. There is a reduction in the number and force of the pulsations. The
influence seems to be entirely upon the muscles of the heart, through overstimulation of the cardiac ganglia, and not through the central nervous system. The heart finally loses its contractility, is flabby, and fails in diastole.
The respiration becomes slower, is shallow and feeble, and finally ceases. The
heart continues to pulsate with increasing feebleness for some little time
after respiration has ceased. The blood is loaded with carbonic acid gas, and
the corpuscles are altered in their character..

The general muscular relaxation from this agent is most marked. Small,
long continued doses induce feebleness and indisposition to muscular exertion. By full doses, tremors of the voluntary muscles are induced, and finally
complete muscular paralysis. The muscular structure of the walls of the intestines is sometimes affected by tetanic spasm, followed by complete relaxation and paralysis.

The mind may continue clear. The influence, at first stimulant, is finally
motor depressant, abolition of reflexes appears, with ultimate paralysis of the
motor nerves, more slowly occurring.

It is quickly absorbed and readily eliminated through all the emunctories.

Upon the eye, when locally applied, this agent acts first by contracting
the pupil. It afterward decreases intraocular tension, and produces spasm
of accommodation and myopia. There is often pain of a severe contractile
character produced in the eyeball.

Specific Symptomatology—The remedy is indicated when there is a
feeble pulse, tremulous, perhaps slightly irregular, cool extremities and cool
surface, breathing more or less difficult, with a sense of constriction. These
symptoms are found present in some cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis. Administered in minute doses in this disease, it will be found to occupy a place
between belladonna and gelsemium. It may be given in conjunction with
echinacea with very good results. It overcomes the tendency to mental dullness and stupor and wards off impending coma. The agent is useful where
there is torpor, inactivity, atonicity of the intestinal canal, and of the organs
of digestion and appropriation, or where from lack of nerve force-there is
deficient secretion, dryness of the mucous membranes, deficient glandular
secretions with dry and hardened feccs.

It increases the contractility of the muscles of the bladder walls, and of
the uterus.

Although a motor depressant in large doses, in small medicinal doses it
has a contrary influence.

Therapy—The agent may be given internally to allay the tension induced by extreme nervous irritation. Convulsive disorders from irritation
are allayed by it, but it is not in general use for this purpose.

It has been used in tetanus, in epilepsy and in convulsions from all
causes, also in locomotor ataxia, in chorea and in progressive paralysis of the
insane. Its influence has not been such as to justify dependence upon it in
these cases.

It stimulates the respiratory function and heart’s action where there is
great depression with difficult breathing, with a sense of compression or constriction of the chest, with soft, feeble pulse, cool, moist skin, and usually
dilated pupils. It is the remedy for dyspnea under such circumstances. It
is also advantageous where the dyspnea is caused by a clogging up of the
bronchi and air cells without power to expel the thick tenacious mucus. It
will liquefy the secretion and increase the power to expel it.

In emphysema and in asthma with great muscular relaxation, in bronchitis with dilatation, it is useful. It restores tone in phthisis and overcomes
night sweats of that disorder.

It may be of advantage in dilatation of the stomach, and in atony and
extreme inactivity of the intestinal muscular structure. In intestinal catarrh
from this cause it is of much service. It is also valuable in catarrh of the
mucous linings of the kidneys and bladder, and in extreme atony, relaxation
and plethora of the abdominal structures. It will assist in overcoming
chronic constipation and a tendency to flatulence in atonic cases.

It is useful in tympanites and flatulence present during the menopause,
where there is atonicity of the intestinal walls and constipation. In the condition known as phantom tumor it has been used advantageously.

Its chief influence is upon the eye. When mydriasis has been induced by
atropine or other agent, a solution of the sulphate of eserine will quickly restore the normal condition. Any adhesions of the iris which may have occurred as the result of inflammation may be broken up by this agent. It is
used to reduce intraocular tension, as has been stated, and to increase the
power of the muscles of accommodation, being valuable in paralysis of these
muscles.

It is useful in conjunctival inflammations where perforating ulcer threatens to permit prolapse of the iris. It is especially advised when ulceration
without determination of blood—indolent in character, nonvascularized—is
present. It is useful in intermittent strabismus, in glaucoma, asthenopia, in
photophobia and in some cases of neuralgia of the eyeball. After injury to
the eyeball many conditions may occur which will be promptly relieved by
the use of this agent.

Edison of Indiana wrote some years ago an excellent article on the
treatment of meningitis, in which he lays great stress upon the action of this
remedy. Whether the difficulty be spinal or cerebro-spinal, whether it be
acute or chronic in character, he claims to obtain benefit in all cases, and cure
in the larger percentage of cases, by the direct influence of calabar bean, especially if there be an underlying primary congestion, plainly apparent. He
uses in conjunction, however, counter irritation in all cases,

To an infant he gives of a mixture of from eight to ten drops of the tincture in four ounces, a teaspoonful every half hour. To an adult he would
administer two drops every fifteen minutes, until spasms or marked symptoms are under control, then he would give the dose every two or three hours.
He lays great stress upon small doses frequently and persistently repeated.
I believe it more useful if given in careful combination with gelsemium.

The remedy is useful in the treatment of spinal irritation, in one or two
drop doses, frequently administered. The doctor has depended upon this
remedy for twenty-five years, and the results have established a fixed confidence in its influence.

Oo-operatives—It may be combined with xanthoxylum, strychnine, nuxvomica or capsicum with advantage. Belladonna will facilitate its action,
also, in its influence upon gastrointestinal structures.

AMMONIUM CARBONATE. AMYL NITRITE.
AMMONIA.
Formula—NH,.

Under pressure of only 6.5 atmospheres, it is reduced to a colorless, mobile, unstable liquid.

Anhydrous Ammonia—This liquid will solidify at 103 Deg. Fah. It volatilizes rapidly with the abstraction of heat.

The compounds of ammonium are formed by the saturation of the ammonium radical NH,. In its compounds it acts similarly to sodium and

potassium.
Aqua Ammoniz.:

Formula—NH,HO. Ammonium Hydrate.

Synonym—Ammonia water. Formed by the sofution of the gas in
water. It contains ten per cent, by weight, of the gas.

Aqua Ammonie is a transparent mobile liquid, colorless, with a pungent,
stimulating odor and an acrid taste. It is positively alkaline in reaction.
The gas is volatilized by heat, reducing the strength of the agent.

Physiological Action—In full strength aqua ammonie is caustic and irritant, applied to the skin. Internally it is a corrosive poison, producing gastroenteritis. If inhaled in extreme quantity, it produces mental confusion
and cerebral congestion.-

Therapy—It is used as a stimulant and antacid. It stimulates the action
of the heart and the respiration. It has long been in use as an antidote to the
poison of venomous insects and reptiles. In extreme collapse, after severe injury, it has been injected diluted into the veins, but this is heroic treatment
and is not commonly resorted to.

The agent is in common domestic use for the treatment of syncope. If
given internally, from five to fifteen minims, well diluted with water, is the

ose..

Externally applied it produces speedy vesication. Closely confined the
cuticle may be removed in a few minutes.

As a liniment it has long been used. One part of aqua ammonie combined with from two to five parts of olive oil makes an excellent application
to enlarged and indurated glands, swollen condition of the muscular tissues
without inflammation, strained and sore muscles, and local soreness from any
cause. It is probably one of the best applications to the swelled limb in phlegmasia alba dolens. It should be applied very freely, the limb swathed in cotton and a roller bandage applied over all.

Spirit of Ammonia.

Description—Spirit of Ammonia, formerly called ammoniated alcohol, is
made by dissolving ten per cent of ammonia gas in alcohol. It is a colorless
flluid, with the odor and taste of ammonia. Internally it is but little used,
being replaced by the aromatic spirit. It has the alkaline properties of the
aqua ammonia, and its stimulating properties are enforced by those of the alble iene it may be given in doses of from five to twenty drops, fully

Aromatic Spirit of Ammonia.

Occurrence—The aromatic spirit of ammonia is made by dissolving the
carbonate of ammonium in water and adding a solution of ammonia, volatile
oil of nutmeg, oil of lemon and dilute alcohol, all in proper proportions.

Therapy—It is prescribed wherever there is great weakness or prostration, with feeble action of the heart. It is immediate in its influence and reliable in its action. In hysterical conditions accompanied by nervous weakness and in general nervous debility it is in common use. It is of temporary
benefit in cerebral anzemia, as it is an active stimulant to the capillary circulation of the brain. Internally it stimulates the action of the stomach, neutralizing hyperacidity, overcoming many forms of sick headache and relieving
gastric and intestinal flatulence. It is given in doses of from five to thirty

Liquor Ammonii Acetatis.

Synonyms—Solution of Ammonium Acetate, Spirit of Mindererus.

Dose, from one to three fluid drams in sweetened water.

Therapy—The agent has the characteristic stimulating effect of ammonium upon the system. If the skin he warm and the capillary vessels dilated, it acts as a diaphoretic, stimulating excretion through the cutaneous
glands; but if the skin be cold and the capillaries are contracted, it acts profoundly upon the kidneys as a diuretic. In eruptive fevers, where there is imperfect circulation and the eruption fails to appear readily, it is sometimes an
excellent remedy. Later, in these fevers, if there is depression of the nervous
system, with inactivity of the skin and kidneys, it is valuable. Given in postscarlatinal nephritis, with dropsy, it is sometimes most efficient. It acts in this
condition in perfect harmony with belladonna, digitalis and santonin.

It is given in the convalescent stage of all protracted and exhausting inflammatory diseases, strengthening the action of the heart and increasing the
tone and restoring the functional activity of all the organs of nutrition. It
does not produce unpleasant head symptoms. It certainly sustains the powers of life in these cases and conduces to a more rapid recovery.

It has long been in common use among alcoholics. Ifa dram of it be given
in a half glass of water it will sober an intoxicated person and produce a temporary steadiness of the nerves. The dose may be repeated every half hour if
necessary until its effects are permanent in overcoming the debauch.

This agent is used in la grippe, in acute laryngitis, and in acute pharyngitis. It is especially valuable in acute coryza, and if given with aconite or
other direct diaphoretics, it quickly overcomes the constitutional effects of a
severe cold. It is of value in some cases of rheumatism, because of its stimulating influence on excretion.

In passive menorrhagia or in metrorrhagia, where there is debility with
muscular relaxation and nervous weakness, it is a specific remedy. In ovarian
pain from passive congestion, and in uterine pains at the menstrual epoch, with
the conditions above named, it is a useful remedy.:

Externally it has long been employed as a discutient to indolent abscesses, glandular swellings, engorgements, and to dissipate incipient abscess
in the mammary glands.

AMMONIUM CARBONATE.

Formula—NH, HCO, NH, CO,.
Synonym—Carbonate of Ammonium.

Administration—It is objectionable to the taste and care should be taken
to render it palatable by elixirs and flavored syrups. The dose is from two
to twelve grains in a proper menstruum.

Therapy—This agent is a quick and sure stimulant for sudden and extreme depression. It arouses the heart’s action promptly and supports it in
threatened collapse. It is common practice to combine ten or fifteen grains
with as many minims of the tincture of digitalis when there is surgical shock,
or severe intestinal hemorrhage in typhoid, and repeat the dose, or give a
smaller one, as soon as the effect of the first one is dissipated, until the reaction occurs. It restores from syncope. It is used in the collapse of profound
anesthesia, to overcome the depression of the heart and respiratory functions.

Its alkaline reaction renders it valuable as an antacid, and an excess of
gastric acidity should determine its selection for more prolonged use. It is a
superb stimulant in cases of greatly diminished vitality after prolonged illness, or in chronic disease, where there is hyperacidity of the gastric and intestinal secretions. It is valuable in hysteria with acid eructations and frequent sick headache, with a thick tongue, the papille of which are greatly
elongated and tipped with a whitish coat, and the mucous membranes of a pale
color. In nervous, feeble women without ambition, constantly irritated, with
inactivity of the vital functions, this stimulant is prompt and reliable.

It is not as useful in epilepsy as the bromide of ammonium, nor as a sedative in feeble nervous conditions as the valerianate of ammonium, but it is indicated when greater force, greater stimulation and increased power are demanded. It is more of a stimulant than a sedative, and is especially effective
in asthenia.

This agent is one of the most common of the stimulating expectorants. It
is a restorative to enfeebled conditions of the bronchial membranes when there
is an excessive outpour of mucus, which seems to enfeeble the patient, and is
therefore indicated in chronic bronchitis and in bronchorrhea. In small, frequent doses it is useful in the later stages of bronchitis, and in pneumonia in
children it supports the vital powers and restores normal function. If there
is obstructed breathing, with deficient oxidation and feeble heart action, it is
a useful remedy.

This agent acts in many cases upon the skin. In febrile conditions, with
feebleness, it is a very excellent diaphoretic. Dr. Peart, of England, used the
carbonate of ammonium in three hundred cases of ecarlet fever, and claimed
success in every case. It is given in small doses every hour, reducing the fever
and delirium, inducing sleep and stimulating the action of the skin and kidneys. It developes the rash in all cases, and where there is a retrocession of
the eruption it will quickly restore it to the surface. Minger speaks most
highly of this remedy in scarlet fever, measles and erysipelas. If this agent
is depended upon, chemical incompatibles, as acids, must be avoided. The
agent is best given with milk, when much of its unpleasant taste is obscured.

The carbonate of ammonium is used to counteract the effects of many
poisons which have a depressing action on the system, such as veratrum, gelsemium, aconite, digitalis, hydrocyanic acid and others.

AMMONIUM PHOSPHATE.

Formula—(NH,), HPO,.

Synonym—Phosphate of Ammonium.

Administration—The dose is from five to thirty grains dissolved in
water and administered every three or four hours.

Therapy—lIt is, or should be indicated in those cases where, with general nervous prostration, there is feebleness of the heart’s action, and in fact
feebleness of all the vital functions due to deficient nerve power. It may be
used in these cases with expectation of good results, as it is a stimulant restorative to the nervous system. It promotes elimination, and has been used
freely in gout and chronic rheumatism in enfeebled patients.

AMYL NITRITE.

Formula—C, H,, NO,.

Bynonym—Nitrite of Amyl.

Administration—In its administration, glass pearls containing about
three minims of this agent are crushed in a handkerchief and the fumes inhaled. This method prevents overadministration.

The agent should usually be administered with the patient in a recumbent position, because of its immediate and profound impression upon the
circulation.

In reducing the dose of this remedy the best plan will be to dissolve five
minims in one dram of dilute alcohol. Of this one minim will equal 1-12 of a
minim of the nitrite. It can be given then as indicated.

Physiological Action—Because of the extreme volatile character of the
agent, its influence upon the system is prompt and violent in proportion to
the amount used.

It produces headache, confusion of ideas, vertigo, and relaxation of both
voluntary and involuntary muscles. There is dilatation of the retinal vessels
with hyperemia.

It is exceeded in its promptness of action upon the nervous system by
hydrocyanic acid alone. It affects the motor side of the spinal cord. Its ingestion induces staggering, loss of co-ordination, flushed face, fullness of the
head, roaring in the ears and general muscular relaxation. The heart’s
action is increased-in force and rapidity. There is great dilatation of the arteries by temporary paralysis of the sympathetic. The heart finally becomes
weak and the blood assumes a dark hue. The respiration is at first rapid,
but increased doses produce slow and labored breathing from depression of
the respiratory nerve. The heat of the body is reduced.

In poisonous doses the pulse gradually becomes slower, the heart is
greatly weakened, the respiration is slow and shallow, the temperature is
sub-normal, the extremities cold, there is great muscular weakness, cyanosis,
extreme vertigo, disordered vision and death from failure of heart and respiratory action.

_Used for its therapeutic effects the agent is administered by inhalation.
A single breath of the vapor of three drops will produce a flushed face and
dizziness, throbbing of the carotid arteries, with sensation of fullness in’ the
head and quick pulse.

Therapy—It is a profound restorative in extreme conditions. It was
first used to overcome chloroform asphyxia, and is exceedingly efficacious
where the influence of chloroform has produced profound cerebral anemia.

194 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

It is a popular remedy in the treatment of angina pectoris. If the attack
is accompanied by high arterial tension, the relaxing influence of this agent
will give immediate relief.

Because of its influence in relaxing the muscular system it is used in
general and local muscular spasms. It is useful in epilepsy to overcome the
spasm, and when there is an aura its inhalation will abort the attack. It is
used in tetanus and in the convulsions of strychnine poisoning with excellent
results, but it must be given, if possible, preceding the spasm, as the respiration is usually interfered with. It will relax the spasm in puerperal eclampsia, but at the same time it produces relaxation of the unstriped muscular
fiber of the womb and permits post-partum hemorrhage.

It is too active for use in the convulsions of childhood, although it is
sometimes so advised. It is used in spasmodic asthma, in whooping cough
rs in laryngismus stridulus, but should not be administered to young chilen.

This has been advised for occasional administration in chronic nephritis,
with high arterial tension, and also in cases of extreme cerebral anemia. In
both cases, however, it is replaced to an excellent advantage by nitroglycerine.

It has proved to be of much value in that condition so much complained
of by ladies at the menopause, or during the child-bearing period, when the
menses have been interrupted in their regularity, and at other times with all
patients when there are flushes of heat, local burnings of the skin, flushed
face or burning hands; where the venous capillaries are engorged in certain
localities, and are more or less empty in others—an irregularity of distribution of the blood in the capillary circulation. These irregular flushings have
been satisfactorily corrected by the internal use of one drop of the nitrite of
amy] three or four times daily. If the patient is sensitive to the action of the
Raa a small dose may be given. One, two or three minims may be inled.

Antidotes—In the treatment of poisoning by this agent, profound diffusible stimulants are necessary, and perhaps artificial respiration, with
strychnine, strophanthus or digitalis, hypodermically, is essential to sustain
the heart, and cold should be applied to the head.

NITROGLYCERINE.

Formula—C,H, (NO,),.

Synonyms—Glonoin, Trinitrine.

Administration—The alcoholic solution, the Spirit of Glonoin or Spirit
of Nitroglycerine, is the preparation used in medicine. It is formed by combining one part of nitroglycerine with ninety-nine parts of the rectified
spirits of wine. It is a clear, colorless liquid with the odor and taste of alcohol. It must be handled and tasted with extreme care.

The dose is one or two drops, of the above one per cent solution, graduated according to its rapidity of action. A single overdose will induce a
fullness of the head with a feeling of pressure and pain.

Physiological Action—Two drops upon the tongue often produces immediate acute cerebral engorgement, with flushed face and violent headache.
The use of this agent as a powerful brain stimulant and to induce cerebral
hypereemis, is becoming more and more general. Its effects are immediate
and more or less violent. It stimulates the heart’s action and induces nausea.
It induces other phenomena similar to those of the amy] nitrite.

Therapy—In sudden or acute cerebral anzmia from any cause, especially
that induced by sunstroke, it will act in a manner superior to any other
agent. It has controlled many cases of post-partum hemorrhage by determining the blood to the nerve centers and increasing nerve control.

Tt has acted nicely in angina pectoris and in cardiac neuralgia. In
anemic headache it is a specific remedy. It may be continued for some days
if necessary, in doses of one minim of the one per cent solution every two or
three hours. In exhaustion following prostrating fevers, used hypodermically, it is an emergency remedy for the following conditions; asphyxiation from drowning or from gases; in opium poisoning, especially it there be
uremic symptoms; in angina pectoris; in palpitation, and in all forms of asthma. It is useful given before an attack in epilepsy, and in tetanus. It is
useful in reflex vomiting; in renal and hepatic colic; in anemia and anemic
headaches especially, because it loads the capillaries of the brain. It is also
useful in albuminuria, and wherever an agent is needed to reduce arterial
tension. It may be given just before a chill in intermittent fever or pernicious malarial attacks, warding off the cold stage.

Dr. Neiderkorn reported excellent results from the use of 1-250 of a
grain of glonoin in a case of nephritis with serious complications. There was
an enormous quantity of albumin in the urine. The glonoin was given every
three or four hours for a patient who was cured.

In the treatment of cocaine poisoning nitroglycerine is given hypodermically with good results. It is claimed that if it be used in advance of the
administration of cocaine, the local effect of that medicine would be determined without any constitutional influence. This is an important fact.

Berberine (Hydrastin, yellow). Dose from one-half to five grains.

Hydrastine (white). Dose, from one-tenth of a grain to three grains.

Constitvents—Berberine, Hydrastine, Canadine.

Physiological Action—In its influence upon the nervous system, this
agent has stimulating properties in part analogous to those of strychnine.
Its influence is more slowly developed and more permanent. In extreme doses
it blunts the sensibility of the terminal nerve filaments, and convulsions have
resulted from its use.

It stimulates the respiration and circulation, imparting tone and increased
power to the heart’s action, increasing arterial tension and capillary
blood pressure. It influences blood stasis similarly to ergot and belladonna.

The tone imparted to the muscular structure of the heart differs from
that imparted by strychnine in being permanent and not spasmodic or intermittent in character. In influences muscular structure everywhere in the
system in the same manner. It stimulates normal fibrillar contractility and
increased tonus, encouraging the nutrition of muscular structure. It inhibits
the development of superfluous muscular tissue and abnormal growth within
that teen It is thus most valuable in altered conditions of the heart -
muscle.

In its influence upon the gastro-intestinal tract it is tonic, restorative
and soothing in its action. It promotes the appetite, increases the secretion
of the gastric and intestinal juices and conduces to a restoration of the normal condition. It increases peristaltic action and general muscular tonus in
the structure of walls of the stomach and intestines.

decreased irritability of the vagus, the blood pressure is suddenly decreased
and the heart fails in diastole.

Its elimination is comparatively active and is largely accomplished
through the kidneys.

Therapy—In its therapeutic influence its widest range of action is upon
the stomach, in functional disorders of that organ. It is the most natural of
stimulants to the normal function of digestion. Its influence upon the mucous
surfaces renders it most important in catarrhal gastritis and gastric ulceration. It supersedes all known remedies as a local, and also as a constitutional tonic when this condition is present.

In administering this remedy, if there be irritation, the fluid and less
bulky preparations are preferable. If there be marked atonicity with inactivity of the stomach and lack of nerve sensibility, the powdered drug in
five grain doses is the most useful. This increases the tone, reduces abnormal secretion, stimulates normal excretion, promotes the appetite and increases the quantity of the digestive juices, and thus favors the digestion.
It is most excellent in indigestion in such cases, acting in a more rational
manner than the digestives which have no influence beyond that immediately
exercised upon the food within the stomach.

In extremely irritable conditions a solution which contains one or two
drops of the specific hydrastis, or the colorless hydrastis, or in extreme cases
the one-twelfth to the one-fourth of a grain of the sulphate of hydrastine or
of the hydrochlorate of hydrastine is preferable to large doses of hydrastine
or the powdered hydrastis. In some cases powders, or the precipitated
principle, will irritate the stomach, producing weight, distress or even mild
pain if the stomach is empty. In such cases it is best given after a little
food has been taken, or in conjunction with the subnitrate, or the oxide of
bismuth, or with a digestive if the stomach contains food.

In those cases of atonic dyspepsia, where the entire apparatus, including the liver, is stagnant and inoperative, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of the
fluid hydrastis or of the colorless hydrastis dissolved in water will restore
a normal condition of the glands and of the entire mucous membranes.

The agent relieves the chronic constipation of plethora or muscular inactivity in relaxed, inactive, feeble cases. Its influence is encouraged by
combination with nux vomica. It overcomes hepatic congestion in such cases
and catarrh of the gall ducts. It may be combined with podophyllum,
leptandra or iris..

It is a most superior remedy in the atonic conditions of these organs
in chronic alcoholism, and if combined with large doses of capsicum and
with forced nutrition, will in great part supply the demand for alcoholics
and assist in the cure of the disease. It acts as strychnine does in the cure,
and may be most beneficially given in combination with that agent.

The tonic and nerve strengthening properties of this agent have long
been utilized by-the writer in all cases of general debility and nerve prostration, especially if associated with the conditions of the digestive and assimilative organs named. It is an admirable restorative tonic. It is demanded
in convalescence from protracted fevers and debilitating inflammation, and
as a general restorative after overwork, in the condition known as a complete ‘‘breaking down.”’

The usual manner of prescribing it is to give a grain of hydrastine, two
grains of the bisulphate of quinine, one grain of the carbonate of iron and
one-fourth of a grain of capsicum in a capsule every three hours, after eating
something simple, that the stomach may not be entirely empty. The improvement is remarked by the patient usually from the first. It is a simple tonic, but has no superior. In some plainly indicated cases, the quinine

salt may be replaced with one-fourth of a grain of nux vomica.

The influence of the agent is certainly direct upon the central nervous
system, promoting a normal circulation and increasing its nutrition. It will
yet be found applicable in the treatment of cerebral engorgements of
a chronic character, and in the treatment of hyperemia of those organs, in
the cases in which ergot is used.

It is valuable in from one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful doses of the
fluid Hydrastis, or colorless Hydrastis, in water, in prostrating night sweats.

In its power over the nutrition of muscular structure, it is a most important remedy in many disorders of the womb. It produces contraction of
the unstriped muscular fibers, slowly but permanently stimulating the removal of excess of growth. In parturition it is not so immediate or forceful
as ergot, but acts mildly in the same manner. In uterine subinvolution, in
menorrhagia or metrorrhagia from this cause, it is the best remedy we have.

It is useful also in post-partum hemorrhage, but is rather slow in its
action when immediate results are demanded. In the incipient stage of the
development of tumors within the uterine structure, or fibroid growths, it
is not excelled by ergotine. It may be used hypodermically in these cases,
and its results are comparatively permanent.

In the treatment of cancer or scirrhus of the breast Dr. Hale has had
excellent results from the use of this remedy. He uses the mother tincture
in conjunction with conium, giving five drops at a dose three or four times
a day, the hydrastis before, the conium after meals. He says: ‘‘Sometimes,
I mix them and give ten drops of the mixture three times a day.’’

Hydrastis is directly indicated where the tumors are hard and painful;
conium where they are small, hard and painless. Where the swelling is soft
or undulated and painful on pressure, and pain extending into the axilla, we
find phytolacca in the same doses better than either. Sometimes all three
remedies are good together, and none of them is valuable in the open cancer.
The remedies must be continued a long time to make a decided impression,
and their effect is even increased by the same remedies being applied externally in the form of a plaster.

In all catarrhal conditions, especially if there be muscular relaxation
and general enfeeblement, it is a useful remedy. It may be given internally
and used locally. It is used locally in solution and is of much value as an
application wash, irrigating fluid or gargle in all such catarrhal, ulcerating,
aphthous, indolent and otherwise unhealthy conditions of mucous surfaces.
Its application to nasal catarrh has been mentioned. It is a most useful
gargle in aphthous or ulecrated sore mouth, in conditions where the gums
are spongy or loosened from the teeth or bleed easily. In diphtheria and
in tonsilitis as a gargle it is extremely useful.

Ten minims of a fiuid preparation, to the ounce, may be used, or a solution of the hydrochlorate of hydrastine in nasal catarrh, in inflammation of
the eyes and in gonorrhea. One grain of the hydrochloraté in an ounce of
rose water, with or without five grains of the sulphate of zinc, is of superior
value in purulent conjunctivitis. The same preparation, diluted, is useful in
gonorrhea. Five drops of the solution in a dram of warm water is the
proper strength. The colorless hydrastis in a solution with a small quantity
of the potassium chlorate is sometimes superior in nasal catarrh. It is most
serviceable in this condition if dilute.

It is the best of washes in leucorrhea, whatever the cause, and it can
be used freely without danger and in various strengths—from one dram to
three, to the pint of hot water. It is of much service when the discharge
is thick, yellow, and the membranes relaxed and feeble. In simple cases half
a dram to the pint is beneficial.

It forms an excellent wash in eczema of the anus, with ulcers or fissures
within the rectum. Its use may be followed with the application of a zinc
ointment, with twenty-five per cent its weight of bismuth subnitrate. In
mild solutions of the hydrochlorate of the alkaloid one-fourth grain to the
ounce, it is serviceable in catarrh of the bladder, as an irrigating fluid.

We find in addition to the tonic influence of this remedy, that it has been
used in a number of cases of gall stone, with curative results. Professor
Farnum claims to have cured a number of cases with the powdered hydrastis.
The cases which he regards amenable to this treatment are, first, ordinary
cases of cholelithiasis, where the symptoms are transient and not severe;
second, acute inflammatory cases, usually attended with fever, and catarrhal
conditions of the gall ducts; third, cases ordinarily called biliary
colic. Those, of course, where organic change has not taken place, or
where the stones are not impacted, in the gall bladder or in the ducts. He
uses it as an efficient remedy in catarrhal jaundice where there is no pain
to indicate the presence of gall stones in the ducts. This is in harmony with
its influence on general catarrhal conditions of the gastro-intestinal tract.

Goss claimed that it had direct catalytic power, and aided the digestion,
while it corrected the biliary function. It restores the mucous lining of the
gall duct, in the same manner that it influences other mucous surfaces.

Cuthberton gave hydrastis canadensis as a tonic to a pregnant woman
who had a goitre of recent appearance. The goitre was promptly cured. As
a result of this observation, he treated twenty-five other cases of goitre at
the time of puberty, or during the pregnant state. At times when interference with the function of the reproductive organs seemed to produce reflex
irritation. He claims that every case was cured by this remedy. He gave
the agent from six weeks to three months, three times a day after eating.
One of the patients had become steadily worse under the use of iodine, the
iodides, and thyroid extract. This patient began to improve as soon as hydrastis was given, and was promptly cured with this remedy alone.

Webster calls attention to the influence of hydrastis upon the mammary
gland. It has been reported as a remedy for mammary cancer, but its more
satisfactory influence is upon painful fulness of the mammary gland, during
the menstrual period, or for the treatment of local enlargements occurring
more or less suddenly, of a benign character, either in maiden ladies or at
the menopause.

There is an abundance of authority for the use of hydrastis in conjunction with conium maculatum, in the treatment of non- mammary
tumors. The two agents combined seem to have an influence that neither
possesses alone. Two minims each of these two remedies, in the specific
form, was given by Webster before meals and at bed time, in these cases,
with satisfactory refults. The doctor reports in detail quite a number of
cases which were relieved or cured by this treatment.

GOLD AND SODIUM CHLORIDE.

Formula—AuCl,-+NaCl.

Synonym—Chloride of gold and sodium.

PREPARATION—Made by adding to a solution of the gold chloride, a solution of an equal amount of the pure sodium chloride. The mixed solutions are
thoroughly stirred and evaporated and the double or mixed salt is thus precipitated. The crystals are of a golden yellow color and are permanent in the
air. It is soluable in water and partially so in alcohol.

Dose, from one-twentieth to one-fourth of a grain.

Specific Symptomatology—tThe direct indications for its use in gastric
troubles are a red, sleek or glazed tongue, anorexia, pain increased on the
ingestion of food, extreme epigastric tenderness with bowel movements apparently induced by the taking of food.

It is indicated also in general exhaustion of the nervous system, especially if complicated with an impairment of the blood, or with constitutional
dyscrasia, as it is an active alterative, acting much as mercury and its salts
are claimed to act.

Therapy—The chloride of gold and sodium is of value in the hypochondria and nervous weakness of tertiary syphilis. It is of value in all forms of
Bright’s disease, but should be used cautiously, if at all, in the latter stages.
It is useful in tuberculosis, in chronic diarrhea to sustain the nervous forces,
and in chronic dyspepsia, and other hindrances to appropriation and assimilation.

In general impairment of the digestion and nutrition it is an excellent
stimulant to the stomach and nutritive functions of the intestinal canal. It
is a stomachic tonic of much value. In these cases it should be given in doses
of not more than the sixteenth of a grain and even down to the one hundred
and twentieth or two-hundredth, and repeated every two or three hours. Its
influence upon the liver at these times is believed to be most satisfactory,
especially if catarrh of the bile duct or duodenum is present.

It seems to exercise a selective action for the genito-urinary organs. It
has been commended in chronic irritation and even in chronic inflammation
of the uterus and of the ovaries, where this condition has made a profound
impression upon the nervous system, and induced nervous exhaustion with
a general atonic condition of the system. It has been long used in syphilis
and other blood dyscrasias where the results named were marked, and where
there was impaired nutrition, also where there were enlarged lymphatic
glands and scrofulous swellings or ulcerations. In diabetes mellitus the
agent has been spoken well of, and in some cases it is an important addition to the treatment. The chloride and the double chloride are both used
in the treatment of dipsomania, seldom alone, but usually in conjunction
with the sulphate, or the nitrate of strychnine and atropine, and for its moral
effect, in some cases with apomorphine.

The results of the combined treatment have been, no doubt, satisfactory,
as the statistics of ‘‘retreats and reform institutions’ show nearly ninetynine per cent of cures. It would be gratifying indeed if but a fraction of
this number could be cured of the deadly habit, and most satisfactory to
know that the administration of these agents hypodermically, and other
agents, such as capsicum, per os, and strong concentrated nutrition, will
cure many cases. A discouraging relapse, from the continued influence of
vicious associates, or the entire physical or mental collapse of an occasional
patient whose constitution was completely undermined by previous indulgence, should not deter the physician and friends from making a most determined. and persistent effort to restore every patient desiring restoration.
It is useless to undertake to cure one who does not desire to be cured, as
fature indulgence will render his physical and mental condition more debased than before.

Some of those who have used mercury in the treatment of syphilis, believe that all the alterative effects of that agent are found in this, and in
addition the profound nerve tonic and restorative influence of this agent
renders it much superior.

PHOSPHORUS.

Symbol—P.

Occurrence—Phosphorus was discovered by Brandt in the product of
evaporated urine, in 1669. It does not occur free, but is always found in
combination, most often with calcium, sodium and potassium. It is derived
from the ashes of bones, in which it exists as the tricalcium phosphate.

Description—An elemental, translucent, wax-like, yellow solid, luminous
in the dark, unstable in the air; insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol,
petroleum, ether and the bisulphide of carbon. It melts at 112 degrees, boils
at 554 degrees, giving off a colorless vapor.

It may exist in two distinct allotropic states. The first is the form just
described, and the second is the variety known as the red phosphorous. The
red variety is insoluble in those solvents which will dissolve the other form.
It has no odor, does not oxidize in the air and is neither luminous nor poisonous. It is prepared by retaining the ordinary variety at a heat of 500 degrees for thirty-six hours. The heat destroys its affinity for oxygen.

Administration—It should be given in doses of from the one-one hundred and sixtieth to one-eightieth of a grain and repeated according to the
indications. Larger doses may be given if its physiological effects are
desired.

A tincture is prepared by macerating phosphorus for thirty days in alcohol, with occasional agitation, in the proportion of fifteen grains to thé
ounce. It is not officinal. One drop of specific medicine phosphorus, carefully increased, may be given as a dose.

Physiological Action—It is violently poisonous, producing its effects by
deoxidation of the blood. In overdoses it produces violent inflammation of
the stomach and intestines, intense burning pain, prostration, cold skin,
clammy perspiration, vomiting and death. There is great anxiety, restlessness, intense headache, vertigo, wild erotic delirium and coma. The vomiting is of a coffee-ground liquid, resembling the black vomit of yellow fever.
The urine is scanty and albuminous, and may be finally suppressed.

Its protracted use will in some cases induce a phosphorus habit, very
difficult to overcome.

The agent is the most powerful nutritive stimulant to the nervous system, and a valuable nerve tonic—a trophic in the strictest sense, as it suplies a needed constituent. For this effect it is given most often in its cominations, but there are specific effects that can only be obtained when the
agent is given in its uncombined form. After a dose of the one-twentieth
of a grain there is a peculiar exhilaration experienced, a renewed capacity
for mental and physical exertion. There is increased strength and renewed
vigor.

The acids of Phosphorus, and the phosphates and hypophosphites, are
common restoratives to the osseous and nervous structures of the system.

Specific Symptomatology—Its direct indications are exhaustion of the
nerve forces, more or less complete, of a general character, as that following protracted fevers and malignant disease. Occipital headache of nervous
exhaustion, especially that following mental strain and over-work, The
insomnia of nervous prostration is quickly relieved by it.

Therapy—lIn loss of nerve force of a local character it is reliable, such
as functional impotency, neuralgia from cerebral anemia and weak heart
action from nervous exhaustion. It is valuable in mental failure, in paralysis agitans and in certain diseases of senility.

The remedy in minute doses acts directly upon the organs of the chest.
It overcomes and prevents pulmonary engorgement. It quiets the cough of
phthisis, strengthens the patient, moderates the diarrhea in these cases,
and removes chest pains. It is a valuable agent in dyspnoea, whatever the
cause, whether of heart faults or disorders of the lungs. For stitches in the
chest of a neuralgic or inflammatory character, it is specific. It is valuable in
bronchitis, pneumonitis and pleuritis, with the indications of increasing
weakness, sharp stitchlike pains, and short, dry, hacking cough. For intercostal neuralgia it is very sure.

Beyond these indications it has been used successfully in many cases of
malignant jaundice. Its direct influence on the urinary apparatus is to induce diuresis with relief of existing irritation. It relieves vesical and prostatic irritability, especially if from sexual excesses. It has been used with
good results in psoriasis, lupus, eczema and acne.

Toxicity—The eating of match-heads by children induces poisoning, also
an overdose of the agent in medicinal form. The symptoms are a peculiar
taste in the mouth and the odor of the substance on the breath. There is
burning pain throughout the gastro-intestinal tract. There is vomiting and
purging of matter which may be luminous in the dark. Symptoms of gastrointestinal inflammation rapidly follow, involving the intestinal and glandular
organs. The condition of the liver, post-mortem, is similar to that of yellow
atrophy, although at first it may be enlarged. There is fatty degeneration
of all organs. Jaundice will finally occur, with vomiting of coffee-ground
matter. There is obstinate constipation, with clay-colored feces. Muscular
twitchings, vertigo, extreme headache, delirium, becoming wild; spasms, unconsciousness and death ultimately follow. The urine becomes dark-colored,
scanty and albuminous, with fatty casts.

In parties subjected to constant contact with phosphorus a chronic form
of poisoning occurs, as necrosis of bone, beginning with necrosis of the inferior maxilla. It is said none are safe from an attack if they work two years
in phosphorus.

Antidotes—If phosphorus has been recently taken, the stomach must be
evacuated at once. An old ozonized oil of turpentine is the physiological antidote, but it can seldom be obtained, and the fresh oil or other oils will
facilitate the absorption of the agent. The permanganate of potassium is a
correct antidote. Dilute solutions of this, or of the peroxide of hydrogen,
may be administered.

The after effects must be met with stimulants, tonics and restoratives
as are indicated.

In the treatment of chronic poisoning, the patient must be entirely removed from the cause, and restoratives as indicated used. Elimination is essential. The kidneys should receive much attention, and if not
diseased should be stimulated to free activity. Vegetable alteratives will be
of much service.

ACIDUM PHOSPHORICUM.

Formula—H,P0,.

Synonym—Phosphoric acid.

Description—This acid is a colorless liquid, almost odorless, and with a
strongly acid taste.

cial Phosphoric Acid is obtained from calcined bones by the action of

sulphuric acid; it occurs as a white uncrystallized fusible solid, with a very
sour taste and without odor. Sparingly soluble both in water and in alcohol.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 190

AGENTS WITH STIMULANT AND TONIC PROPERTIES 208

Neither of the above forms of phosphoric acid are used in medicine to
any great extent.

Dilute Phosphoric Acid is formed by the addition of three and one-half
ounces, by weight, of phosphoric acid, to twenty-six and one-half ounces, by
weight, of distilled water. This contains ten per cent of absolute orthophosphorie acid.

This process results in the formation of a colorless liquid, with powerful acid properties. It does not, however, possess the corrosive action of
other mineral acids.;

Physiological Action—This agent in its physiological action resembles
phosphorus only in a general way. It is a stimulant and sedative to depressed
irritable nervous conditions when an acid is indicated in the system. It
allays pain and distress of a subjective character probably more or less imaginary, present with hysterical conditions, and also in irritable patients suffering from nervous exhaustion.

Therapy—tThe agent is an excellent remedy for the so-called nervous dyspepsia. It adds tone to the nervous structure of the stomach, digestive and
assimilative organs, materially aiding these functions. Its influence as a
nerve sedative and tonic may be partially due to this stimulating influence
over general nutrition.

If the characteristic indications present are those of an excess of acids,
the excess is probably that of hydrochloric acid which may be neutralized
before the phosphoric acid is given, when the latter agent will at once assist
in correcting the gastric fault and will improve the condition of the nervous
system.

Von Martinetz writes me that any case of debility, weakness, and lack of
vitality may be corrected by this remedy, because the brain and the nervous
system are directly influenced.

He says: ‘‘In the ulcerative stage of syphilis, I give phosphoric acid,
and with the best results. In rheumatism, the acid, in certain cases, is a
most excellent remedy, and if its indications are present, it will cure where
other remedies fail.’’

*«When I meet cases that require arterial sedatives in high temperatures,
I give gelsemium, rhus tox, and bryonia, if these are indicated, and later I
give the patient full doses of phosphoric acid. Sometimes I give these two
classes of remedies alternately every two hours.

“In osteomalacia, or softening of the brain, phosphoric acid has a directly
beneficial effect, superior to other treatment because its combinations
directly build up the bone structures. I saw in the hospitals of Prague,
under Professor Taks, many cases that had been treated with no result,
which improved rapidly under phosphoric acid.’’

“‘A lady patient had spinal trouble, and became very weak. Finally I
placed her on phosphoric acid treatment, and in the shortest time possible
she made a permanent recovery.”’

Phosphoric acid stimulates the sexual function, increasing the tone of
the ovaries and testicles, overcoming in some cases spermatorrhea. It corrects certain abnormal urinary sediments, rendering insoluble phosphates
soluble, and easy of elimination.

Given in the manner advised for aromatic sulphuric acid in low forms of
fever or in violent inflammatory fevers, with typhoid symptoms, it not only
acts as 8 stimulant to the functions of nutrition, but it apparently increases
nerve force. This fact is most important. It thus increases the force of the
heart’s action, giving strength and volume to the pulse. In none of these
effects, however, it is quite equal to phosphorus, properly administered.

AVENA. AVENA SATIVA.

Synonym—Oats.

ConstituENts—Avenin, fixed oil.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Avena. Dose, from five to sixty minims.
Concentrated Tincture Avena. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

As a nerve stimulant and permanent tonic, this valuable agent was comparatively unknown, when the first edition was issued. The writer took the
responsibility of introducing it here through the confidence acquired by observing its prompt and satisfactory action during an experience of twenty
years in the treatment of nervous diseases. There are many well-known and
lauded agents that are hardly to be compared with this for prompt action
upon the nervous system.

Administration—Avena Sativa should always be given in appreciable
doses. Fifteen drops, three or four times daily, well diluted, will usually
meet the case. It may be given in doses of from five to sixty drops in rare
instances. It should, however, never be given in larger quantities than
twenty minims unless the patient is thoroughly accustomed to the remedy,
and has found the usual dose insufficient. Otherwise there is danger of obtaining the physiological effect of the drug, which is announced by pain at
the base of the brain. When this symptom makes its appearance the mediae should be discontinued for a day or two, and then given in reduced

loses.

If administered in hot water during the day, its action is much quicker,
and in cold water at night on retiring it has a more extended influence. When
given in hot water, its action at times, is almost instantaneous.

Physiological Action—Its selective influence is directly upon the brain
and upon the nutritive functions of the organism, increasing nerve force and
improving the nutrition of the entire system. The influence of a single full
dose is promptly felt, similar to the influence of any active stimulant, but
more permanent. It is a stimulant, sedative and direct nutritive tonic, apparently restoring the wasted elements of nerve force.

Specific Symptomatology—The following indications for the use of this
remedy are given by King: Spasmodic and nervous disorders, with exhaustion; the nervous debility of convalescence, cardiac weakness from nervous
exhaustion; spermatorrhea, with the nervous erythism of debility. In general
neurasthenia it promptly relieves the almost unbearable occipital headache,
so constant, and evidenced by an enormous waste of the phosphates in the
urine, common with nervous exhaustion.

It is a remedy of great utility in loss of nerve power and in muscular
feebleness from lack of nerve force.:

In the overworked conditions of brain workers—ministers, physicians
or lawyers—in the general prostration from great anxiety and worry, it acts
in the same lines as phosphorus and in many cases fully as satisfactorily.

With these, there is so-called nervous dyspepsia, atonicity, in fact, of the
entire gastrointestinal tract. There is heart feebleness with some irregularity; there is cool skin and cool or cold extremities; there is melancholia,
irritability, peevishness, vagaries of thought, morbid desires and fancies,
usually accompanied with autotoxemia which demands persistent elimination. With these avena is directly indicated.

In sexual neurasthenia it is the remedy par excellence, as it has a selective influence upon the nerve structure of the genito-urinary apparatus.

Therapy—It will be found directly serviceable in paralysis and wasting
disease of the aged, in nerve tremors, and especially in chorea and in paralysis agitans. It has been beneficial in epilepsy.

AGENTS WITH STIMULANT AND TONIC PROPERTIES 205

In the convalescence of prostrating disease, and during the asthenic or
later stages of inflammatory and exanthematous disease and diphtheria, it
is as important as quinine and strychnia, and certainly as reliable.

The local paralysis of diphtheria has no better antidote, and if given in
hot infusion during the course of acute exanthematous disease, it quickly determines the eruption to the surface and promotes convalescence.

Because of its selective action upon the nervous structure which supplies
the reproductive organs, it will be found to allay nervous excitement, nervous palpitation of the heart, insomnia and mental weakness, or failure and
general debility caused by masturbation, over sexual indulgence, or onanism.
It is a sovereign remedy in impotency. This writer has had better satisfaction in the use of this agent in the temporary impotence of young newly
married men, than from any other single remedy or combination of remedies.
If there be prostatic or other local irritation, a combination of this agent
with saw palmetto will cover the field.

In uterine or ovarian disorders with hysterical manifestations it is of
much service. The nervous headaches of the menstrual epoch, especially
those accompanied with burning on the top of the head, and sick headaches
apparently from disordered stomach at this time, or in fact sick headache
at any time if accompanied with nervous weakness, are all promptly benefitted by Avena Sativa, provided gastric acidity is neutralized. In atonic
amenorrhoea with great feebleness, it is valuable. In neuralgic and congestive dysmenorrhea, with slow and imperfect circulation and cold skin and
extremities, it is an excellent remedy.

Dr. Simmons of Toledo, Ohio, in the Gleaner, mentioned the use of avena
in acute coryza. His method resulted in a manner highly satisfactory in
every case. Those who are subject to colds in the head, he furnishes with
a small vial of specific avena. With the first indication he has them take
twenty drops of hot water. This may be repeated or increased to thirty or
forty drops in two hours, but the third dose is usually sufficient to remove
every evidence of coryza if present, and to prevent its occurence. The first
evidences of its action may appear in five minutes. If twenty drops do not
produce a feeling of warmth in the face and flushing of the skin, the next
dose is increased.

This agent exercises a restorative power in overcoming the habits of
alcohol, tobacco, morphine, and opium. It will enhance the value of other
prescribed agents.

In the’ treatment of the morphine habit, our subsequent experience has
not confirmed our early anticipations, and yet it is a useful addition to the
treatment. It should be used in conjunction with capsicum, strychnine,
xanthoxylum, or hyoscyamine hydrochlorate, and sustained in its action by
persistent concentrated nutrition.

In conjunction with cactus, or apocynum, as these remedies are indicated, it will be found of much service in the treatment of weak heart, and
the resulting complications. Webster lay8 much stress upon its action as a
remedy to prevent the recurrence of cardiac rheumatism. This influence
would be facilitated by combination with specific alteratives, and remedies
that will facilitate the elimination of uric acid, without depressing the action
of the heart.

The persistent use of this remedy, especially if conjoined with capsicum
or minute doses of strychnine, will be found of great assistance in certain
cases of paralysis. Its nerve restorative and persistently tonic properties
are exercised fully here.

In a case of cerebral hemorrhage, from which recovery was not to be
expected, Dr. French used ergot and avena with bromide as an occasional

sedative, with satisfactory results. He says: ‘‘I also give avena for the
symptoms of nervous breakdown and exhaustion, regardless of the name of
the special disease from which they may be suffering. Some patients claim
to realize almost instantaneous effects on taking it while others are less
easily affected. In all well-known cases selected for the indications of
paralysis and deficiency of nerve power, it seems to me to be good.

Oo-operatives—It works in harmony with strychnine in its stimulating
influence, but is more permanent in its effect. It exercises an influence similar to quinine after prostrating fevers and is similar to coca and phosphorus
in its restorative powers. Xanthoxylum will enhance its general stimulant
influence, and it may be combined with macrotys and scutellaria and gelsemium in chorea. It is antagonized by nerve depressants and nerve sedatives which exercise no stimulant or restorative influence.

There is no danger of forming the habit of taking the drug, as it can be
suddenly abandoned at any time without evil consequences, even when given
in large quantities.

COCA. ERYTHROXYLON COOA.

ConstiTvENTs—Cocaine, cinnamyl-cocaine, truxil-cocaine, hygrine.

PreParaTions—Extractum Coce Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Coca. Dose,
from one-half to one dram.

Specific Medicine Coca. Dose, from one-half to one dram.

Physiological Action—The natives of South America and_ laborers
in that country use coca, chewing the leaves, much as tobacco is used in other
parts of the world. It abolishes the sensation of hunger for a time. This
may in part be accounted for by its producing anesthesia of the nerves of
the stomach. It does not take the place of food. It increases the powers of
endurance and confers a singular immunity from the suffering incident to
privation and excessive physical exertion. These effects are accounted for,
in part at least, by the anxsthetic effect of cocaine, which is its pricipal constituent. In large doses it increases the animal heat and quickens the pulse
and respiration. By increasing the dose the nervous system is excited, with
increase of desire for muscular exertion; while in poisonous doses it causes
delirium, hallucinations and congestion of the brain. The general effect of
coca is to stimulate the nervous system and retard retrograde metamorphosis.
The prolonged use of the drug causes a degeneration of the nervous system
aertairias of narcotics, though when used in moderation this effect is not
observed.

The influence of coca on the native habitue of the tropics, and its influence upon the civilized inhabitants of the temperate zones are very different
influences. Its continued use among the latter is most serious, inducing habits more degrading and pernicious than the use of opium and alcohol, and as
fatal to mental and physical integrity.

The effects attributed to the drug are only what might be expected
from the action of so powerful an alkaloid as is contained in the coca leaves.

Therapy—There are few cases of neurasthenia in which this agent will
not be found useful. Taken after dinner, it serves often to facilitate digestion, and even confirmed dyspeptics find their distressing symptoms relieved
by it. It is of especial value in cases where exhausting mental labor has led
to morbid depression of spirits. It is valuable in all cases of despondency.
It relieves the nervous irritability that follows over-indulgence of any kind,
restoring the capacity for work and renewing the energy.

AGENTS WITH STIMULANT AND TONIC PROPERTIES 207

It acts to an extent as an antidote to the effect of opium, alcohol, tobacco
or coffee, and judiciously used is said to enable one to overcome the morbid
craving for any of these stimulants when they have been used to excess.

It is used by public speakers and singers, who have found themselves
in better voice after using it.

As a remedy for nausea and vomiting from reflex causes, particularly in
the vomiting of pregnancy, the cordial proves extremely efficacious. For this
purpose it should be taken a few moments before meals, and the dose repeated in an hour or so afterwards. Gastralgia is frequently relieved by this
remedy, and nervous headaches often disappear under its use.

It is of service also in cases of asthma. It is an aphrodisiac and emmenagogue. It is an antiperiodic. Internally and locally it has been used for
hemorrhoids. As a restorative in feeble heart it is of much value.

KOLA. COLA ACUMINATA.

Synonym—Kola nut.

ConstiTuents—Caffeine, Theobromine, tannin, fat, sugar, starch, gum.

PreparaTions—Extractum Kole Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Kola. Dose,
ten to thirty minims.

It is prepared by different manufacturers in the form of wines, cordials
or elixirs. A solid extract is also prepared.

Physiological Action—The natives of the western portion of tropical
Africa use the seeds of kola most extensively to overcome fatigue, to support the strength on long marches, and to overcome depression of spirits and
melancholy. It is most highly esteemed and is in as common use as tea, coffee and cocoa in civilized countries, closely resembling the first two named.

The agent sustains physical strength to a remarkable degree. It is a
tonic to the heart, increasing the strength of its impulse; it regulates the
pulse, increases arterial tension, induces diuresis, but retards tissue metabolism. It is a stomachic tonic, inducing a normal appetite and good digestion.
It restores normal action in debilitated conditions of the intestinal tract.

Therapy—It is used in neurasthenia and hysteria, characterized by great
mental despondency, foreboding, brooding, more of a quiet or silent character. It is especially indicated if the heart is feeble and irregular in its
action, with general muscular feebleness. In cerebral anemia it is indicated
and is an excellent auxiliary in general anemia. It is an excellent restorative after prostrating fevers and protracted exhausting disease. It is of
specific value in melancholia.

In weak and enfeebled conditions of the heart muscle, with valvular
weakness, dyspnea, irregular action, it is of benefit, the influence being
quickly exhibited on the pulse, and an improved sense of well-being experienced.

It is recommended as a substitute for alcoholic drinks, and has been
used to most excellent advantage as a stimulant and restorative in the treatment of the drink habit. Those most enthusiastic claim that it alone will
cure alcoholism.

It is advised in chronic diarrheeas, with great lack of tone. It has been
used in sea sickness, one ship surgeon claiming that he had used it on many
voyages, and had found it to relieve even the most susceptible, in many cases.
The agent is without doubt a valuable one in its field.

CHAPTER IL

Stimulants with Sedative Properties.

COFFEE. CAMPHOR MONOBROMATE. MUSK.
CAMPHOR. MYRRH. OSMUNDA.
OOFFEE. COFFEA ARABICA.

ConstITUENTS—Caffeine, volatile oil, Caffeotannic acid, proteid, dextrin,
glucose.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Coffea. Dose, one to ten minims. Caffeina Citrata, Citrated Caffein. Dose, three to eight grains Caffein. Dose,
one to five grains.

Physiological Action—Poisonous doses of coffee or caffeine cause delirium, semiconsciousness, a slow and irregular pulse, cold extremities and
cold, clammy perspiration, lowered temperature, anesthesia, cramps, tremors,
a reeling gait, convulsions, dimness of vision, increase of urine. The habitual
and excessive use of coffee as a beverage causes indigestion, with acidity,
cardiac irritability, vertigo, headache, irritability of disposition and despondency.

Therapy—The tincture of coffee made from the unroasted berries is a
nerve stimulant and antispasmodic. It increases the heart’s action and produces a rise in arterial tension. It is of value in nervous headache, and in
vertigo from imperfect circulation in the nerve centers—in cerebral anemia.

Coffee is used as a stimulant to antidote the effects of narcotic poisons.
In opium poisoning its effects are prompt and immediate. A strong decoction is prepared and injected within the rectum, if impossible to administer
it per orem.

The late Dr. Brodnax, beginning in 1876, used coffee as a stimulant in
the debility of slow fevers, especially in protracted pneumonia with feebleness. He found it in every way superior to whiskey.

He observed that new born infants that kept up a whining cry for days
always succumbed ultimately from some one cause or other. He took raw
coffee beans, ground them and made a strong tea with which he succeeded
in curing the condition in every case in which he used it.

CAMPHOR. CINNAMOMUM CAMPHORA.

Imported from Japan, China, Formosa.

Occurrence—A concrete volatile oil (stearopten), obtained from the
Camphor Laurel, purified by sublimation, found in tough crystalline masses,
white and translucent; easily powdered in alcohol or chloroform.

Physiological Action—In its influence there is something of a diversity
of opinion concerning the method of action of this agent. It is certainly a
sedative with power to increase the tone and improve the functional activity
of the nervous system.

Therapy—It has long been used in hysteria to control the attacks and to
relieve the nervous excitement, restlessness, nervous depression, melancholia
and hypochondria. In sudden depression from exhaustion and the conditions
of depression consequent upon neurasthenia, it serves a good purpose.

In all forms of nervousness in women and in children and in the feeble
it has long been in common use. In the excitable mania of exhausting fevers,
it serves a useful purpose. It allays nervous excitement and produces a general tranquillity of feeling..

STIMULANTS WITH SEDATIVE PROPERTIES 209

It is a sovereign remedy for acute coryza—‘‘cold in the head,’’ and may
be inhaled or taken internally. In acute and chronic catarrh it has a tonic
yet soothing effect upon the mucous membranes. It controls hypersecretion
and restores normal functional action.

These facts are also true in catarrhal bronchitis, in asthma and in
whooping cough. In these spasmodic coughs the anti-spasmodic influence of
the agent is of prime importance.

It is of service when added to cough syrups as a stimulating sedative in
the persistent coughs of capillary bronchitis.

It has a marked anaphrodisiac influence, and has been given freely in
nymphomania, satyriasis and erotomania. Its influence in controlling sexual
excitement is positive. It cures priapism, chordee, and in a general way reduces the power of erection and the sexual appetite. In sexual weakness and
in nocturnal emissions accompanied with erotie excitement from over indulgence, with violent erections, it is of much use and may be combined with
ergot to equalize the circulation of the organs.

It is a stimulating diaphoretic in fevers, and in inflammatory disorders
with inactivity of the sudoriferous glands. This is especially true in exanthematous fevers, and where there is mania in prostrating fevers. Its influence is marked in adynamic fevers where there is feeble, rapid heart action
and irritable pulse, with dry skin and muttering delirium, with subsultus tenee It has a diffusive stimulating influence in these cases which is of
value.

It is combined with opium and ipecac in the well known Diaphoretic
Powder, in the proportions of one part each of camphor, opium, and ipecac,
with seven parts of the potassium sulphate. The dose is from two to ten

CAMPHOR MONOBROMATE.

Synonym—Monobromated Camphor.

Occurrence—Formed by heating bromine and camphor in a sealed tube
on a water bath. The crystalline product is dissolved and recrystallized,
first from water, then from alcohol.

Description—Prismatic crystals, colorless, with the odor and taste of
camphor, permanent, soluble in alcohol, ether and chloroform, insoluble in
water.

Dose, from one-tenth to five grains.

Administration—For children a good preparation is made by taking one
part of the crystals and triturating it thoroughly with nine parts of the sugar of milk. Of this one grain may be given every hour to a child of two
years.:
Physiological Action—The agent has the properties of a stimulating sedative, exalting the nervous functions when depressed, when there is great
restlessness, excitability or delirium. It has marked anodyne and hypnotic
properties under proper circumstances.

Therapy—lIt is prescribed in nervous excitement or extreme restlessness’
accompanying inflammatory disease or protracted fevers. It is specific in
nervous irritation from reflex causes.

It is an excellent remedy for children with the long train of symptoms
resulting from irritation of the dental nerve.

The indications are diarrhea, nausea, great restlessness, fullness of the
circulation of the head, with heat, sleeping with half open eyes, rolling of
the head, and tossing, crying out with little sharp cries. These symptoms
occur at any time during development of the milk teeth.

210 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

In fully developed cases of cholera infantum, with the extreme symptoms of involuntary watery discharges, cold extremities, pinched features,
emaciation, apparently uncontrollable vomiting, this agent is given in full
doses, and it will often meet alone the whole train of indications.

It is a hypnotic when fever and general distress induce wakefulness.

In delirium tremens it has produced good results, and in mild cases of
the delirium of protracted fevers, with restlessness, it will be found of advantage.

It has been used in chorea, and in hysterical manifestations of an excitable character, and in nervous palpitation, and irregular heart action from
reflex irritation.

MYRRH." COMMIPHORA MYRRHA.

ConstITUENTS—Volatile oil, Myrrhol, Glucocide, resin, gum.

PreparaTions—Tinctura Myrrh, Tincture of Myrrh. Dose, from five to
thirty minims. Tincture Aloes et Myrrhe, Tincture of Aloes and Myrrh. Dose,
from twenty minims to two drams.

Physiological Action—A stimulant to the nervous system, with tonic properties. A stimulant with local action upon mucous membranes and glands
and glandular organs; antiseptic. In overdoses, emetic and actively cathartic, decreasing bronchial secretion.

Specific Symptomatology—Myrrh is specifically indicated in a general
sense where there is adynamia or extreme asthenia, with weak, inefficient capillary circulation, cold skin, weak pulse and deficient circulation.

It increases the power and frequency of the heart and respiratory action,
and conduces to a general sense of warmth and increased vigor.

Therapy—This agent has always been highly esteemed as a stimulant,
although its influence is more of a local than a general character. It exercises the characteristic influence of most of the stimulants upon the excretions and secretions, acting as a diaphoretic, expectorant, sialagogue, and to
a certain extent emmenagogue.

It was once popular in the compound tincture of capsicum and myrrh.
As a most active general stimulant in ulcerative, engorged, flabby and atonic
conditions of the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat this agent acts.
promptly. It stimulates the capillary circulation, restores tone and normal
secretion and causes the healing of ulcerations. It is useful in sore mouths
of all kinds, and especially in syphilitic sore mouth and sore throat. It may
be combined with other washes or gargles or it will act promptly alone.

It will quickly cure the beginning of syphilitic ulcerations in the throat
and mouth. In the spongy gums and aphthous sore mouth of children, in
stomatitis materni if combined with an alterative and tonic astringent it will
assist in the cure of the very worst cases without taking the child from the
breast. An infusion made of white oak bark, yellow dock root and myrrh,
to which may be added a mild antiseptic, as baptisia, echinacea, or boric acid,
will cure the most intractable cases of this latter named disease. Myrrh is
excellent in the sore mouth and extreme ulceration of mercurial ptyalism.

In its influence upon the digestive apparatus Myrrh is direct in its action. It quickly increases the power of the digestive function, stimulating
the peptic glands to extreme action. It increases the appetite and promotes
the absorption and assimilation of nutrition. It is given in atonic dyspepsia
in the absence of inflammatory action, especially if there is excessive mucous
discharge from the bowels.

It is exceedingly useful in the apepsia and extreme inactivity of the
stomach in alcoholics, either alone or combined with capsicum.

STIMULANTS WITH SEDATIVE PROPERTIES 211

While it is expectorant, and stimulates the secretion from the mucous
membranes when inactive, it influences to a satisfactory extent the restoration of the functions of those membranes when the secretion is excessive, as
in catarrhal conditions. In deficient or excessive action it restores the normal conditions.

In debilitating expectoration of phthisis pulmonalis it suppresses secretion and increases the patient’s power to throw it off. In excessive mucous
secretion from any organ it has a direct influence. In atonic catarrhal diarrhes of a subacute or chronic character its influence is specific and satisfactory.
In some cases of catarrh of the bladder it is used internally, and in the
irrigation fluid also. It is valuable in prostrating leucorrhea.

It is an old popular remedy in amenorrhea given in combination with
aloes and iron, especially in chlorotic and anemic patients. It has long been
in use in the old school for this purpose. It may be combined also with
macrotin to a good advantage.

MOSCHUS. MUSK.

A penetrating, odoriferous, granular substance obtained from the perputial follicles of the musk deer of the Himalaya mountains in Central Asia
from China to Tibet.

Tincture Moschi, Tincture Musk. Dose, from twenty minims to two
drams.

Therapy—This agent is a powerful diffusible stimulant, anti-spasmodic
and aphrodisiac. It produces symptoms similar to those of alcoholic stimulation. It is used to overcome collapse and as a stimulant in all profound
depressed conditions. It is useful either in nervous excitement or depression, if induced by exhaustion. It is a remedy for extreme exhaustion following severe prostrating fevers at the time of collapse.

As an antispasmodic it ‘may be used for hiccough, whooping cough and
other spasmodic coughs, and in hysterical convulsions and in the convulsions
of childhood. It is similar in its action to camphor, asafetida, valerian and
ammonia.

OSMUNDA. OSMUNDA REGALIS.

Synonyms—Buck thorn brake, Royal flowering fern.

PrepaRaTiIoONsS—An infusion of the roots is given and taken quite freely.
A tincture may be obtained. The substance is very mucilaginous, and an infusion will quickly become jelly-like.

Specific Symptomatology—Diseases of the bones, from malnutrition.
Weakness of the osseous structure, rickets, diarrhea and dysentery from
local irritation in poorly nourished patients.

Therapy—With some physicians this agent is very popular in the treatment of the above disorders. It is also useful in weak back, especially in
those cases where, with weakness of the muscular structure of the back, there
are symptoms of incipient disease of the spinal vertebre. It has been used
also in subluxations,

In the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery, whether acute or accompanying protracted fevers, the agent is said to be very beneficial, especially
if accompanied with great weakness. Also as a tonic during convalescence,
when these conditions have prevailed. It has been given in various forms
of female weakness, particularly where there was severe leucorrhea. Its
soothing influence upon mucous surfaces seems to be remarkable.

GROUP II.

Agents Acting Upon the Heart.

CACTUS. CRATZGUS. CONVALLARIA.
DIGITALIS. STROPHANTHUS. LYCOPUS.
CACTUS. CACTUS GRANDIFLORUS.

Synonyms—Cereus Grandiflorus (Haworth); Night-Blooming Cereus;
Cactus Grandiflorus (Lin.).,

PrePaRaTIONS—Extractum Cacti Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Cactus. Dose,
from one to twenty minims.

Tinctura Cacti, Tincture of Cactus. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Specific Medicine Cactus Grandiflorus is prepared from the green stem
of the true species. The dose is from one-third of a minim to two minims.
This is a reliable preparation. Although the medicinal effects may be obtained from two minims, larger doses may be given, no toxic effects having
been observed..

The dose of cactus, usually prescribed in the past, has been small, generally not to-exceed five minims. A foreign writer has made some observations in aortic lesions, with faulty compensation. He believes that cactus is. distinctly specific for these lesions, but he advises it in much larger doses.
He gives half a dram if necessary three times a day. The patients treated in
this manner had great dyspnea, arrythymia, with edema of the extremities
and ascites. He demonstrated the recession of the cardiac dilatation in these

Physiological Action—This remedy increases the musculo-motor energy
of the heart, elevates arterial tension, increasing the height and force of the
pulse wave. This is accomplished by increased heart action, stimulation of
the vasomotor center, and stimulation of the spinal-motor centers, increasing
their activity and improving the general nerve tone. It is the heart tonic
par excellence, as it produces stimulation from actually increased nerve tone,
through improved nutrition of the entire nervous and muscular structure of
the heart. It produces no irritation of the heart muscles like strophanthus,
or gastric irritation or cumulation like digitalis.

Cactus exercises a direct influence over the sympathetic nervous system,
regulating its action, restoring normal action, whatever the perversion. It
acts directly upon the cardiac plexus, regulating the functual activity of the
heart.

Investigations have proven that it increases the contractile power and
energy of the heart muscle, through the intercardiac ganglia and accelerator
nerves. It certainly improves the nutrition of the heart, as we have noticed
the entire removal of progressive valvular murmurs after its continued use.

Specific Symptomatology—aAn irregular pulse, feebleness of the heart’s
action, dyspnea, weight, oppression in the chest, violence of the heart’s action, depending upon atonicity or enervation, and a sensation of a constriction or band around the heart or around the chest, are the direct indications
for its use in heart troubles.

Therapy—This agent is prescribed where the heart muscle is enfeebled,
where there is progressive valvular inefficiency, with irregular or intermit212

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE HEART 218

tent pulse. It is valuable in mitral or aortic regurgitation from whatever
cause.

It is an exceedingly useful agent in functional irregularity of the heart,
however evidenced, if due to gastric irritation, as the agent in doses of from
one to three minims, soothes gastric irritability and imparts tone and improved function, in wide contrast to digitalis, which irritates the stomach.

The action of cactus with nux vomica and hydrastis in the treatment of
functional palpitation, depending upon an atonic condition of the stomach,
must be emphasized. If extreme acidity be present, they may be combined
with an alkaline agent or with neutralizing cordial (glyconda). A number
of be physicians recognize this influence, and my own experience confirms
its value.

Those who have used all the heart remedies unite in the belief that for
breadth of action, for specific directness, for reliability and smoothness and
general trustworthiness, cactus takes preference over all the rest. Its influence is admirable where indicated and it is invaluable in many cases. Other
remedies in some cases will do as much in single lines, but none will do more,
and none will exercise all of its desirable influences.

The writer has given it in valvular troubles, in weak and irregular conditions, depending upon muscular enervation, and in aortic regurgitation,
and has seen cures accomplished that had been thought impossible. It permanently strengthens the muscular action of the heart.

The author’s experience with this remedy caused him to come to the
conclusion a few years ago that cactus had a special sedative influence where
indicated. He was convinced of the fact ultimately and now finds excellent authority for his conclusion. Rubini, of Naples, claims that it is almost the counterpart of aconite in its action, differing in that it increases
the strength and tone of the nerve centers instead of paralyzing them, as
large doses of the latter agent does. Given a condition in which there is a
rapid and feeble pulse, weak heart, weak and exhausted nervous system,
cactus in small doses, frequently repeated, is a true sedative.

Cactus as a powerful nerve tonic can be relied upon when there is any
irregularity of the heart, demanding such a remedy in conjunction with general nervous weakness. It is especially indicated where there is mental depression with despondency and forebodings. It is combined with avena, nux
or macrotys as I have often suggested with superb results. The above named
combination will act as a tonic in a surpassing number of cases of nervous
weakness without regard to the specific indications. It improves the nutrition of the brain by improving the circulation in that organ. In this it is of
advantage in some cases of neurasthenia, especially in those in which there
is a sensation of a band or cord around the body or chest or head, a symptom
often spoken of in nervous exhaustion, and in forms of paralysis. Where
feebleness is the cause of nervous excitement, cactus exercises a nerve sedative influence. In oppressive headache in the top of the head, causing nervousness, common to ladies at the menopause, resulting from irritation in
the pelvic organs, or congestion, or menorrhagia with excessive losses of
blood, it is of benefit..

Where there is increased arterial tension, and exaltation of nerve force
and excess of strength in the cardiac action, cactus is contraindicated. This
is true in prescribing it for heart disease and palpitation. We have had several cases of palpitation, depending on exaltation of nerve energy, increased
by cactus, and decreased by gelsemium, cimicifuga or the bromides.

It may be given with excellent results combined with avena sativa in
impotence accompanied with general nervous exhaustion, or in combination
with avena sativa and saw palmetto in the feebleness and impotency of ap-

proaching age, or in the prostration following habits of dissipation, when it
will accomplish most excellent results.

It is given in endocarditis and in pericarditis following exhausting diseases as sequele, with the most gratifying results,

In a marked case of endocarditis following measles, with purple and
bloated countenance, distressing dyspnea, and a pulse so rapid, feeble and
fluttering that it could not be counted, the dyspnea was overcome, the heart
beats reduced to 120, and regular, and every condition improved in the most
satisfactory manner in twenty-four hours, incredible as it may seem, by the
use of one drop of the fluid extract of cactus every hour.

It is useful in valvular incompetency due to muscular weakness, in the
feeble heart action following pneumonia, typhoid and other severe and prostrating diseases. In the feeble heart of exophthalmic goitre, it will do all
that is expected of strophanthus.

Dr. Lydia Ross, of Massachusetts, in the Eclectic Review, reports extensively concerning the action of cactus in the disorders of women. She claims
it to be specific in that form of oppressive headache, occurring upon the top
of the head, not uncommon at the menopause, resulting also from uterine
malposition, or congestion.

It is especially valuable in the hot flashes which are so disagreeable during the climacteric. Small doses of the remedy are advisable at that time,
and their influence is often a surprise in controlling this otherwise intractable condition. Helleborus niger is an excellent remedy for this condition
and they may sometimes be given in conjunction or in alternation. The melancholia, nervousness, irritability of temper, hypersensitiveness, neuralgia,
vague fears and fancies, present during the menopause, are all influenced
favorably by cactus. Its direct influence in strengthening the nervous system, and in toning the heart and circulatory organs, underlies its influence
upon these conditions.

Other conditions common to women, relieved by this remedy, are cerebral congestion, with weight and pain in the occiput, or in the vertex, numbness of the limbs, cough at the supra sternal notch, pain behind the sternum,
fear of death, general plethora and congestion. Irregularities of the menses,
consisting of a flow too early, too dark and thick, too abundant—a flow which
ceases upon lying down, with an inability to lie upon the left side, demand
its use.

In cardiac weakness of a less chronic or more acute character than those
conditions affecting the aorta, the agent will be found serviceable, as in the
threatened heart failure, due to violent over-excrcise, as the bicycle heart, a
condition not as common as it was when this work was written. It is of great
value, as we have previously stated; in the tobacco heart of the cigarette
fiend or inveterate smoker. Here it is especially useful. We know of no
remedy that will take its place. In the treatment of heart weakness, common to masturbators, and in the feeble heart of the aged, where there are no
great organic changes, the remedy is especially advised.

The specific point present in nearly all of these cases indicating the remedy is a vise-like band around the organ affected. It may be the chest, or the
stomach, or. the heart, bladder, uterus or vagina, or it may be around the
body. There is likely in the severe cases to be suffocation, faintness, cold
perspiration and great fear of impending danger. If with the above symptoms, there be epistaxis, hematemesis, or hemorrhage from any organ or
part, the agent is demanded.

Dr. Lyman Watkins confirms most of the statements made bv Dr. Lydia
Ross in its use in hysterical conditions, and as a remedy to relieve the functional disturbances, which the heart exhibits, from menstrual disorders. He

believes it to be a most valuable remedy in the rapid and feeble heartbeat of
anemia and chlorosis, greatly facilitating the influence of other indicated remedies. He reports a case of a gentleman of thirty who was suffering from
cardiac irregularity of a mild type, accompanied with a persistent and almost
excruciating pain in the deep muscles of the back, over the region of the
kidneys. Morphine and opium had been given persistently, for this severe
pain. Cactus given for the heart symptoms relieved the pain permanently,
in a very short time.

Dr. Coffin, of Indianapolis, uses this remedy to overcome subnormal temperature. He believes that it will prove a satisfactory remedy. I have used
it in a few cases with good results, but unless given in large doses it will have
to be given in conjunction with strychnine, nux vomica, or ignatia.

Dr. Felter reported in the Gleaner in 1907 a case of Raynaud’s disease
where six drops of specific cactus was given as a nerve sedative with curative results on the real disorder. He was greatly impressed by the action of
the agent. It may be combined with macrotys or gelsemium for nervousness,
with pulsatilla for hysteria, and may be given with an alkaline remedy in
very feeble old ladies who suffer from vertigo and general heart feebleness.

One doctor reports an increase of temperature from ten drops of cactus
three times a day. Where there is a nervous hyperesthesia with excitable
ee cactus will aggravate the symptoms, I believe, whatever they
may be.

Cactus in the treatment of heart trouble where there is epilepsy as previously referred to, was fully enlarged on by a writer in the Eclectic Medical
Journal for April, 1912. While the remedy is not always used alone in the
treatment of epilepsy, it was cured. The doctor believes it to be a very important auxiliary.

Cactus has been advised in the treatment of car sickness and in sea sickness. It might be combined with advantage with gelsemium or the bromides.
It has also been given in the treatment of morphine habit, but the case reported by Dr. Cox took cactin tablets. Its action in this line should be observed.

Dr. Carey, of Ohio, gives cactus with strophanthus in combination in
cases where the circulation from heart fault is very imperfect, three or four
drops of each.

DIGITALIS. DIGITALIS PURPUREA.

Synonym—Foxglove.

ConstITUVENTS—Digitalin, digitoxin, digitonin, digitalacrin, a stearopten
digitalosmin, and digitaloic acid.

PrePaRATIONS—Extractum Digitalis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Digitalis.
Dose, from one to three minims.

Tincture Digitalis, Tincture of Digitalis. Dose, from five to twenty

Infusum Digitalis, Infusion of Digitalis. Dose, from one dram to onehalf ounce.

Specific Medicine Digitalis. Dose, from one-sixth to three minims. Prescribed, from five minims to one and one-half drams, in four ounces of water,
a teaspoonful every hour or two.

Physiological Action—Digitalis in full doses produces a great rise in
arterial pressure, followed by a marked fall. It acts on the inhibitory nerves
and on the heart muscle; the increased action being due to vasomotor spasm
and to stimulation of the heart itself. A poisonous dose causes depression

216 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

and a dicrotic pulse, while the immediate effect of moderate doses is to stimulate the heart. Its prolonged use weakens the heart muscle by decreasing
its normal nutrition.

When given in frequent small doses, where absorption is immediate, it
influences all of the organic functions as a depressant; it produces irritation
of the stomach and bowels, increased action of the kidneys, and a marked
change in the character, regularity and frequency of the pulse beat. The influence upon the heart is not always uniform in all such cases, but variable
and often unreliable. The influence is marked and more immediate if a large
dose is given and repeated a few times. The gastric and intestinal irritation
is greatly increased, there is purging, violent vomiting, great prostration
with dicrotic or tumultous, irregular, erratic and uncertain heart action.

In its general irritating influence upon organic function it may cause so
marked an impression upon the renal circulation as to result in spasm of the
vessel walls and suspension of renal action—suppression of urine with profound albuminuria.

Therapy—Digitalis is the direct heart stimulant. Its influence is sure
and plainly apparent in marked sthenic conditions. In prostration or profound weakness, in sudden failure from violent injury, from surgical shock
or from acute poisoning, or in the crisis of extreme exhausting or protracted
disease, its influence given in conjunction with general stimulants is decisive
and satisfactory.

The agent sustains the action of the heart, but does not impart tone as
cactus does, by increased nerve force and improved nutrition of the organ.
Its sustaining power can be maintained by proper administration until other
measures supply deficient power, by encouraging reaction, or by general improved nutrition.

The influence of digitalis in its stimulant effect is nearly diametrically
opposed to that of aconite. In therapeutic action the two agents occupy the
opposite extremes. For this reason digitalis, within the limits of its stimulant action, is a physiological antidote to aconite.

Digitalis slows a rapid and feeble pulse in asthenic fever. It is a sedative in fevers under those circumstances in which aconite is contraindicated.
In prolonged cases where asthenic conditions prevail, and where the temperature remains high, with rapid, feeble, easily compressed pulse or irregular
heart action, all the evidences of failure of vital force, digitalis is the fever
remedy. It controls the pulse, reduces the temperature somewhat, and improves the heart action. Aconite, veratrum and the synthetic antipyretics
will ee increase the condition under such circumstances and are contraindicated.

In pneumonia, when the disease processes have had full sway, and the
heart is unable to properly fill the pulmonary capillaries, and is depressed by
the influence of the general disorder, and the general effects of the accumulated carbonic acid within the blood, and is labored and overtaxed and apparently slowly failing, this agent is directly useful. It promptly strengthens the heart and the nervous structure of the pulmonary apparatus at the
same time.

In minute doses in children, if it be given with belladonna or other
heart stimulants, it shows a most desirable influence in this class of cases,
but should be stopped as soon as these results are obtained, that no untoward
symptoms may occur.

Digitalis is a remedy for passive congestion where the blood stasis has
occurred from feebleness and failure of the circulatory organs. It exercises
a stimulating influence upon the entire apparatus; through its power of increasing heart action it imparts renewed force and an improved capillary

tonus in every part. It such cases its influence resembles that of belladonna,
although not so marked nor permanent.

In valvular diseases of the heart, with muscular relaxation and feebleness, it is a good remedy, but not always the best. It sustains the power for
8 time in those cases where there is stenosis, and where compensatory dilatation has previously occurred. In feeble, irregular and intermittent heart
it is frequently prescribed with excellent results.

Like cactus, it is not a remedy for violent heart action from over action
of the nervous system, or from sthenic conditions.

Cactus is valuable, indeed, in irritable heart from indigestion; in palpitation and irregular action from gastric irritation, while in this case digitalis exercises no beneficial influences whatever. On the contrary, it is apt to
increase the gastric irritation. Cactus soothes the irritable stomach and promotes normal functional operations.

Digitalis is not found in the urine and does not directly influence the
secretory or the excretory functions of the kidneys. Its apparent influence
upon these organs is due to the improved blood pressure from its direct influence upon the heart, inducing increased heart action. Renal congestion is
overcome because the increased heart impulse drives the blood through the
renal capillaries with renewed vigor, and there is thus a copious flow of the
urine from improved renal circulation. Under these circumstances only, is
it a valuable remedy in dropsy. In cardiac dropsy it acts most promptly if
given in infusion in small and frequently repeated doses. Close watch must
be kept for cumulative action. In dropsy from post-scarlatinal nephritis, a
dram or two of the leaves in a pint of water is thoroughly steeped. Of this
from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful may be given every two or three hours.

In general dropsy from heart disease there is deficient capillary circulation, especially when lying down; the pulse is irregular, intermittent and
feeble, the urine is small in quantity, with a large percentage of albumen. Its
power over the heart influences this entire train of symptoms directly. Patients taking digitalis in full doses for an immediate effect should remain in
the recumbent position. This position greatly favors its sedative and tonic
action, and patients have died upon being raised to a sitting posture immediately after taking an extreme dose of this agent. Syncope, especially in
children, is common at such a time. The profound influence of the remedy
prevents the occurrence of the natural change in the action of the heart,
from a prone position to the sitting posture. Digitalis may exercise no apparent influence upon the system when proper doses are given regularly for
some days, until suddenly violent poisonous effects may appear, with irregular and greatly depressed heart action, vertigo, extreme wakefulness, vomiting, irritation of the bowels, with pain and sometimes violent purging.

The cause or manner of its accumulation is variously explained and is
not well understood. Several theories are advanced, none of which are satisfactory. No other heart remedy has these objections. Cumulative action
often shows itself first by the influence of the agent upon the kidneys, in suspending or restraining their action. Consequently if desirable results from
the use of this agent do not appear, and there is a decrease in the quantity
of urine passed, the agent should be suspended, at least for a time.

CRATZGUS. CRATZGUS OXYACANTHA.

Synonyms—Hawthorn, Haw, English Hawthorn.. _PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Oxyacantha; dose, from five to twenty
minims. Fluid Extract Oxyacantha; dose, from ten to fifteen minims. Normal
Extract; dose, from four to eight minims. It is given in water and may be re-

peated every hour or every two or three hours. In extreme cases it may be
given hypodermically.

Therapy—This agent has not yet received much attention from the profession. Dr. Jennings, of Chicago, in October, 1896, published in the New
York Medical Journal a letter containing the following statement:

‘To this date I have successfully treated with crategus one hundred and
eighteen patients who were suffering with various forms of heart disease, not
including fatty degeneration and tachycardia, and ofthe two latter forms of
the disease. I have fourteen still under treatment.

“(Of one hundred and fifty-seven reports from other physicians using the
drug in their practice, all but nine are commendatory and favorable, and of
the nine, eight of them discontinued its use because the medicine made them
sick at the stomach, and the ninth, a physician, said it gave him a fullness
in the head. If these latter had reduced the dose to five or six drops it would
have had full therapeutic effect, and would have obviated the nausea, and
they, too, could then have reported favorably.

‘‘From these results my deductions are that Crategus Oxyacantha is
superior to any other of the well known and tried remedies at present in use
in the treatment of heart disease, because it seems to cure while the other
remedies are only palliative at best.

“‘Orategus may be regarded as specific, or the nearest approach to a
specific, in the following cardiac diseases: Angina pectoris, valvular deficiency, with or without enlargement, endo-myo and pericarditis, tachycardia,
rheumatism (co-called) of the heart, cardiac neuralgias, from whatever cause,
palpitation, vertigo, apoplexy, dropsy, and functional derangements.

“‘The dose of ten to fifteen drops, heretofore announced, is too much,
and a dose of from four to eight drops, four times a day, is to be substituted.”’

Jennings advises the use of tonics and auxiliary agents to meet the indications in extreme cases of heart disease, where a long train of symptoms has
developed from the imperfect circulation and deficiency of oxygenation of
the blood. He says in treating heart disease, he was strikingly impressed
with the rapidity with which cardiac dropsy disappeared under the influence
of crategus. From this he was naturally led to believe that the same treatment would be equally efficacious in dropsies not of cardiac origin, and he
now confirms, clinically, this obvious conclusion. He has also used crategus
with the greatest of success in albuminuria or Bright’s disease, and in diabetes mellitus and insipidus.

Dr. Joseph Clements, of Kansas City, Mo., wrote to Dr. Jennings for
information concerning the remedy, and began taking it. The report of his
case was published in the Kansas City Medical Record in April, 1898.

It was an extreme case of angina pectoris, with regurgitation, edema and
a train of symptoms that pointed to immediate dissolution. After using cactus and other well known heart remedies without result, he obtained some
of Jennings’ fluid extract, and was cured in a few weeks, with permanent
relief from the pain.

Dr. Clements believes that his experiments have shown that the drug
also has a wonderfully solvent power on crustaceous and calcareous deposits
in the lumen of the arteries, resembling the effect of iodide of potassium on
the nodes of syphilis.

He says further, ‘‘a drug whose physiological action and therapeutic
power are solvent and absorptive to the diseased accumulations, and tonic
and stimulative to its nutritive nerve supply, must approach the nature of
a specific as near as anything can approach it, in the disease under discussion.

Some observers claim that the use of this remedy in aged persons, with


<!-- chunk -->

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE HEART 219

arterio-sclerosis, angina pectoris, etc., will prolong their lives beyond the
time when dissolution would have been certain had those conditions remained.

What would be the effect of the medicine in fatty degeneration, atheroma, etc., I am not prepared to say. I think further observation will be necessary before it would be safe to go far with it. In small doses, however, its
tonic effect upon the nerve supply, I think, could not be otherwise than helpIn beginning heart mischief after attacks of inflammatory rheumatism
we will find a promising field of usefulness for this new remedy.

Those who have since used the remedy believe it to be a true heart tonic
and restorative and capable of exercising an immediate soothing and
strengthening influence upon that organ, thereby improving the circulation,
and augmenting oxygenation of the blood. Future experience will determine its merit. I will now say, as I did in 1907, this remedy, although of
great service in selected cases, when used in combination with cactus or other
heart agents, when used alone has hardly met the anticipations of those who
were carrying out the suggestions of the original introducers of this remedy.
It will meet a few indications satisfactorily. I have prescribed it in the
heart weakness with valvular murmurs, great difficulty in breathing, persistent sighing respiration, which accompanies neurasthenia or nervous weakness, brought on in young people, from violent overstrain, or prolonged extreme nervous tension. The results of the sudden breakdown, being similar
in every way to other cases of neurasthenia..

One case was completely cured in about six weeks, by the use of this
remedy, and the arsenate of strychnia. The valvular murmurs showed a
progressive decrease until they had disappeared entirely, as did also the extreme sighing and difficult respiration. Other cases complaining of heart
irregularity with mild valvular trouble, have been materially benefited by
crategus.

That it has an important place in our therapeutics, we have no doubt,
but its exact place is not yet determined.

Dr. Jernigan experimented very extensively with crategus and believes
it is superior to many heart remedies when correctly prescribed. He believed it to have a broader field of action; no accumulative effect; no toxic
pecan no contraindications, and acts in harmony with the other remees..

It has a general curative effect upon the functional action of the central
nervous system; upon every part of the circulatory apparatus; upon the urinary organs, and the processes of metabolism. It dispels gloomy forebodings, increases the strength, regulates the action of the heart, causes a general sense of well being. In its mental influence he thinks he sees a resemblance to the action of pulsatilla, and very often prescribed the two remedies
in conjunction.,

The doctor is sure he has seen excellent results from crategus in the
treatment of diabetes insipidus, especially in children, a difficult condition
to control. He has used it also in exophthalmic goiter with good results. He
gave ten drops of the specific medicine every two hours for a while, controlling a form of epilepsy that showed itself with the other symptoms. He believes the remedy given for diabetes influences innervation, improving the
circulation, especially in the capillaries when there were cold extremities.
All of his cases confirmed his faith in the remedy as an important one for
this condition.

Dr. Dwire, of Ohio, in his report confirms all of Dr. Jernigan’s statement
in its action directly upon the heart.

220 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Dr. Sharp, of Ohio, says that he finds crategus indicated in the usual
diseases of the heart, and gives it in conjunction with the very best possible
treatment to put the system into normal condition with proper diet and attention to the action of the skin, kidneys, and bowels. He reports three
cases of serious heart disease in patients above 78 where the results were
highly satisfactory.

Dr. Stouffer, of Pennsylvania, suffered from a number of mild attacks
of paralysis of the left side. The heart was directly influenced; oppression
heavy; constriction of the throat; all symptoms increasing by exertion. He
combined crategus and scutellaria, two parts of the former to one part of the
latter, adding oil of peppermint, a few drops for the flavor. Of this he took
a drop or two on his tongue very often, or as needed, obtaining relief, not
secured by any other measure.

A greatly enlarged heart in a young man of sixteen with the symptoms
usually present in older patients with precordial bulging was permanently
benefited until a permanent cure seemed to be possible, by five drop doses of
crategus every three hours persisted in, over a period of several months.

Dr. Osborne cured himself of a peculiar asthmatic difficulty of the spasmodic type. He had enlargement of the right side of the heart, the oppressed
breathing at times being very severe. In a paroxysm, he took eight drops of
crategus every fifteen minutes with almost immediate relief. There was no
complete cure but much benefit..

Young women, who from any cause suffer from mitral insufficiency, especially if rheumatism is present or the conditions that lead to it, may be
cured by proper care and the use of five drop doses of crategus three or four
times a day.

STROPHANTHUS. STROPHANTHUS HISPIDUS.

ConstiTvents—Strophanthin. The active principle of the plant, a glucoside, a white crystalline powder, neutral, bitter, insoluble in water, insoluble in
ether and chloroform. Dose, 1/600 to 1/200 of a grain.

Strophanthidin and kombic acid.

PREPARATIONS—Tincture Strophanthus is prepared from the seeds alone.
Dose, 1 to 10 minims administered cautiously.

Specific Medicine Strophanthus is made from the seeds, is of full strength,
and should be given in smaller doses than the official tincture. The dose is
from one-half to five minims.

Granules of Strophanthin containing 1/500 of a grain are prepared and may
be given, two or three granules every half-hour in extreme cases, until the force
and power of the heart are improved, then every two hours.

Administration—In administering the alcoholic tinctures of strophanthus
it should not be prescribed in an aqueous or syrupy menstruum, as the agent
precipitates in these solutions. It should be dropped from the bottle into the
menstruum at the moment of administration.

Physiological Action—Strophanthus is the Kombe arrow poison, acting
vigorously upon all muscular structure and specifically upon the muscular
structure of the heart.

Its action on unstriped muscular fiber is similar to that of ergot. In some
cases it affects the respiratory muscles so profoundly as to produce respiratory
paralysis and death.

Strophanthus, in small doses, renders the pulse stronger and less frequent;
arterial tension is increased. In toxic doses the systolic contractions become
very frequent and very brief, followed, consequently, by enormous increase

## Page 208

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE HEART 221

of blood pressure, to which is added sudden cessation of the heart in systole.
Respiration ceases last. It exercises an irritating influence directly on the
muscle fibers of the heart. Its action on the heart is the same aa that of
muscarine. It does not act on the vaso-constrictors.

Under physiological conditions, the diuretic action is uncertain. Under
pathological conditions, it renders the pulse less frequent, more vigorous and
more regular; it promotes diuresis, causes the disappearance of dropsical swellings, and improves the subjective condition of the patient.

Unlike the most of the heart remedies, the effects of strophanthus seem
to be caused by the agent being brought into direct contact with the muscular structure of the heart itself, after absorption into the blood. There is
excellent authority for the belief that it neither acts through the medulla nor
through the inherent ganglionic heart centers. It acts by contact. It causes
violent contraction of the heart muscle in extreme cases, being the only one
of the heart poisons to leave the heart in systole after death from its use. It
does not influence the vascular system.

The diuretic influence of the agent, if observed, is quite permanent. It
increases the blood pressure in the kidneys to a great degree through its influence on the heart muscles, and thus directly upon the capillary circulation.
It is also direct in its action upon the secreting and excreting mechanism of
the kidney; by this influence its diuretic action is explained.

Specific Symptomatology—The direct indications for this agent are a
weak and rapid heart from muscular weakness, inactivity or lack of contractile power. Apparently strophanthus acts similarly to digitalis, but it is not
a cumulative poison. Pius, of Vienna, says in disturbances of compensation,
strophanthus acts well. The pulse becomes stronger and diminishes in frequency, respiration becomes normal and dyspnea less marked.

Therapy—In rapid and feeble heart strophanthus reduces the pulse and
increases the power. In some cases it also reduces the temperature.

Dyspnea is relieved in a few minutes after its administration, and the
pulse becomes stronger and more regular in less than an hour. Its influence
is exceedingly persistent and can be depended upon sometimes for weeks
after the agent is discontinued.

In asthma the paroxysm is shortened and prevented, diuresis begins, and
edema disappears, not to reappear save in exceptional cases. The patient
experiences a general relief.

It has been employed in fatty degeneration of the heart, in acute endocarditis, in atheroma of the arteries, in chronic Bright’s disease, in ascites
produced by cirrhosis of the liver, and certain pelvic tumors, in the enfeebled
heart after acute and chronic fevers, in acceleration of the pulse, and reflex
palpitation of neurasthenia, hysteria and chlorosis.

Strophanthus is contraindicated in ascites of tumors, hepatic, splenic
and pelvic, in respiratory and circulatory troubles of vasomotor origin, in
active hyperemia, and in cases in which there is a tendency to visceral hemorrages.

In its influence upon the stomach it improves the digestion and increases
the appetite. Like digitalis it may induce gastric irritation if given too long
or too frequently, but this effect rarely occurs. It does not increase nerve

one.

In the Indian Medical Gazette, Dr. Sanders reported seventeen cases of
cholera treated with tincture of strophanthus, all successfully. The results
were quick recovery from collapse and a gradual rise of temperature.

Vacci claimed that in cases of persistent anemia of a chronic character,
in acute anemia from flooding, especially where the heart’s action is feeble
and imperfect, he has found strophanthus to materially assist the appropria-

tion of iron. In some cases where iron had been given a long time, causing
insomnia, general nervousness and palpitation with indigestion where it
seemed necessary to stop the iron entirely, he has used, Blaud’s pill with tincture of strophanthus with excellent tesults. Other forms of iron would probably act equally well.

Strophanthus has been prescribed in many cases of goitre, two drops
of the tincture three times daily were given with a rapid reduction in the
size of the enlargements, and in some cases a cure. In exophthalmic goitre
it has accomplished marked results and has become a permanent addition to
the therapeutics of this disorder. The dose in these cases is from five to ten
drops three or four times daily.

ticaria is reported as having been cured with strophanthus given in
full doses. It is credited with the cure of several cases of tetanus. Clapp,
in the London Lancet, reported a cure of traumatic tetanus after antispasmodics had entirely failed. In this case it had a marked diuretic effect.

Strophanthin is a mild local anesthetic. It is only of service in operations upon the eye and not of great service here. Its effects are slow in appearing and remain long. In animals a cloudiness of the cornea is apt to
appear after its use.

CONVALLARIA. CONVALLARIA MAJALIS.

Synonym—Lily of the Valley.

ConstiTvents—Convallarin, Convallamarin, both Glucosides.

PrepaRATIONS—Extractum Convallarie Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Convallaria. Dose, from five to twenty drops.

Tinctura Convallare. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Specific Medicine Convallaria is always made from the fresh root. It may
be given in doses of from one to five minims in water, frequently repeated,
giving good results, prescribed from one-half to two and one-half drams in
four ounces of water.

All the preparations are stable in water except the fluid extract of the
root. An infusion of the entire plant was used in the most of the original
investigations made. It yields good results.

The Glucoside Convallamarin is given in doses varying from 1-12 of a
grain to one grain. The granules of 1-6 grain afford an excellent form, as
they may be dissolved in water if a smaller dose is desired, or one or more
granules may be given at a dose.

Physiological Action—A poisonous dose to a child produced great restlessness, rolling and tossing, continuous trembling of the arms and legs, and
one attack of general convulsions. There was stupor, from which the
child was roused by the greatest effort, to immediately relapse into it again
on being left quiet. The pupils were moderately dilated, the temperature
became subnormal, the pulse rapid and exceedingly irregular. The respiration was very regular but rapid, shallow or superficial. The face was flushed.
The agent induced no diuretic or diaphoretic influence in this case and no
gastro-intestinal irritation, Bogoyavlenski’s extensive observations of the
action of convallaria upon warm-blooded animals were as follows: It induces
a sudden retardation of the cardiac contractions, with increase of blood pressure. After the period of retardation there follows a strongly pronounced
acceleration of the contractions with still greater increase of blood pressure,
arrest of heart beat with diminution of blood pressure. When the vagi are
previously divided the precursory retardation does not take place. If, during the period of acceleration of the contractions, the peripheral ends of the
vagi are irritated, the usual effect on the heart is not observable.

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE HEART 228

In the left and right ventricles there was found an extravasation of blood
under the: endocardium. Under its influence the quantity of urine is much
increased, and dropsical exudates are promptly absorbed and the weight of
the patient lessened. The diuresis induced by the remedy continues long
after cessation of its administration. The pulse grows fuller, more regular,
and in some cases slower. It is not poisinous and has no cumulative action.

Specific Symptomatology—The direct therapeutic indications are organic heart weakness with valvular inefficiency, especially if accompanied
with dropsy. It is probably an efficient remedy for dropsical infiltration
wherever located, if due to inefficient heart.

Therapy—It strengthens the heart’s action, slows a rapid and feeble
pulse, corrects the rhyme and rhythm, improves the tone and increases the
power of the heart, as evidenced by increased tonicity throughout the entire
capillary circulation. It may be given for a few days and then discontinued
for as many days when its influence remains. Its influence is exercised in a
regular, steady and permanent manner.

Its efficiency in dropsy is evidenced when there is sluggishness of the
general circulation, with extreme inefficiency of the capillary circulation and
greatly diminished blood pressure. In these cases, if the kidneys are not seriously diseased, it can be made to induce extreme diuresis and give prompt
relief.

It can be given with impunity and small doses should not be relied upon
in extreme cases. If prompt effects are desired the tincture in full doses
ean be given in hot water, or an infusion of the entire herb will yield the
best results.

In some cases of chronic nephritis the kidneys will fail to respond to
the action of the agent. But these cases are necessarily extreme ones, as in
many cases of Bright’s disease most beneficial results are obtained from the
use of this agent.

It overcomes general depression, favors elimination, adds power and
regularity of action to the heart, overcomes distress of breathing, conduces
to rest and sleep, and induces a general sense of improved well-being. It is
an excellent remedy with which to improve the tone and vigor of the heart
after the depressing effects of protracted fevers or violent acute inflammation, especially of the lungs and bronchi. It is useful also in the enfeebled
heart of phthisis pulmonalis.

It is of much value in rheumatism, especially when the heart is involved. In rheumatic carditis or pericarditis it serves a double purpose. It
strengthens and improves the tone of the heart, and favors the elimination
of morbific products which cause the inflammation. But few remedies will
act more efficiently. If there is effusion within the pericardium its influence
will be quickly observed.

To sum up the influences of convallaria: It is used to excellent advantage in the tobacco heart from cigarette smoking; in the bicycle heart from
overstrain; in asthmatic breathing from enfeebled heart, especially in chronic. It does not, like digitalis, irritate the stomach unpleasantly. On
the contrary, it is of much service in that form of dyspepsia in which there
is extreme torpor of the stomach, with pale, flabby mucous membranes of
the mouth, broad, thick tongue, with a heavy, dirty white coating. In conditions where the tongue is red and thin, with elongated papille, redness
of the tip and edges, it is contraindicated. It is contraindicated also in fatty
degeneration of the heart.

Germain-Sée mentions the following therapeutic indications:

In palpitation resulting from a state of exhaustion of the pneumogastric
nerves—cardiac paresis, the most frequent source of palpitations.

224 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

In simple cardiac arhythmia, with or without hypertrophy of the heart,
with or without lesions of the orifices or valves of the heart.

In mitral constriction, especially when it is accompanied by failure of
compensation on the part of the left auricle and right ventricle, the contractile force augments visibly under the convallaria, as the sphygmograph
testifies.

In mitral insufficiency, especially where there are pulmonary congestions, and when, as a consequence, there is dyspnea, with or without nervous
trouble of the respiration.

In dilatation of the left ventricle, without compensatory hypertrophy, it
restores energy of the heart, which tends to become more and more feeble
and dilated. In dilatations of the heart, with or without fatty degeneration,
with or without sclerosis of muscular tissue, the indications for convallaria
majalis are clear.

In all cardiac affections indifferently, from the moment that watery infiltrations appear, convallaria has an action evident, prompt and certain.

In lesions with dyspnoea the effect is less marked. To combat cardiac
dyspnea, convallaria is inferior to Quebracho. The combination of convallaria majalis with iodide of potassium in the treatment of asthma
constitutes one of the most useful methods of treatment. One is often obliged
to suspend the employment of digitalis on account of vomiting, digestive disturbances, cerebral excitation, the dilatation of the pupil, which it so often
Produces after prolonged use. No such results obtain from the use of convallaria.

LYCOPUS. LYCOPUS VIRGINICA.

Synonym—Bugleweed.

ConstITUENTS—Volatile oil, bitter principle, gallic acid, tannin.. _Preparations—Specific Medicine Lycopus. Dose, from one to twenty

The principal therapeutic influence of lycopus seems to be upon the thoracic viscera, and consequently upon all lesions having diseases of these organs for their basis. The use of the lyocpus may be confined to certain fixed
indications with better results than follow its indiscriminate use in any general class of cases, regardless of conditions.

Specific Symptomatology—tIn diseases of the heart, either functional or
organic, marked by irritability and irregularity of the organ, dyspnea, feeling of oppression in the cardiac region, its administration is followed by
gratifying results. Hypertrophy and dilatation have been known to undergo marked diminution in consequence of its administration.

Therapy—It possesses tonic, sedative, astringent and narcotic properties, and has been successfully used in incipient phthisis, hemoptysis, etc. It
acts like digitalis in reducing the velocity of the pulse, but has no cumulative effects. In pericarditis and endocarditis its sedative action lessens the
frequency of the pulse, irritability, and its attendant inflammation, in a manner equaled by no other remedy.

Cases of exopthalmic goitre are reported as having been cured by lycopus, and it would be well to give it a thorough trial in this most intractable

ease.

Goss said that in palpitation and valvular disease of the heart, lycopus is
good; in hemoptysis it is so positive in its action that he seldom used any
other remedy. He considered it a sedative as well as an astringent in its
action, controlling the capillary circulation by diminishing the caliber of oe
vessels, thereby reducing the flow of the blood.

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE HEART 225

In diseases of the respiratory apparatus lycopus has been found to be
very useful. Hemoptysis, associated with rapid and tumultuous heart’s
action, yields readily to its influence, as does hemorrhage from any part.
Hale lauds lycopus highly for its efficiency when used in cases of incipient
phthisis and in chronic inflammatory diseases of the lungs. By regulating
the heart’s action and equalizing the circulation in the lungs it mitigates or
arrests the local inflammation.

Chronic irritable cough, arising from the smouldering inflammation in
the lungs, can be cured by its administration. It has been used repeatedly in
the high temperature of typhoid fever with uniformly good results; it not
only effectually reduced the excessive heat, but in so doing, it did not depress in the least the vital forces of the patient.

To a certain extent it acts on the heart as a nerve sedative by lessening
its action, also by constringing the blood vessels; hence, diminishing the flow
of blood. We have in this valuable remedy much that is expected of aconite or veratrum, antipyrin, antifebrin, as an agent to reduce the heat in high
temperature without many of their baleful effects. A dose of from one to
five drops may be given every two to four hours. It is not necessary to give
it regularly—only as indicated.

It is also good in hepatitis, if complicated with pneumonitis, in two-drop
doses, once every three hours. In hematuria, if associated with calculi or
eatarrh of the bladder, lycopus is of benefit alternated with chimaphila umbellata.

Dr. Halbert and others combine lycopus with chionanthus and perhaps
belladonna in the treatment of diabetes.

They claim that it influences patients that are naturally fleshy, previously very heavy, and who lose their excess of weight by this disease.

It is decidedly beneficial in the treatment of diabetes, curing a few cases
after all other remedies have failed. It has proven beneficial in chronic
diarrhea and dysentery, inflammatory disease of drunkards and in intermittents. It promotes digestion, invigorates the appetite, allays gastric and enteric irritability.

Dr. Langford says that lycopus will benefit more gastric difficulties than
any other remedy that he has ever used, but does not specify the most particular indications that would suggest it.

Dr. Eads gives lycopus, fifteen drops every thirty minutes with cold compresses to the nape of the neck, for persistent nose bleeding.

Dr. LeBlane lays great stress on its action in full doses in any passive
hemorrhage.

There are many cases of sealding urine with frequency from vesical irritation that will be overcome by lycopus in full doses.


SPARTEINE. APOCYNUM.. ADONIS.
CAFFEINE. ANHALONIUM. IBERIS AMARA.
SPARTEINE.

Pormula—C,,,H,,No.

Description—Obtained from the distillation of a concentrated infusion
of the tops of the cytisus scoparius, or from the mother liquor after precipating scoparin. It is a colorless liquid of an oily consistence, soluble in
alcohol, ether and chloroform.

Sparteine Sulphate.

Description—A crystallized product from the action of sulphuric acid on
sparteine. It is crystalline, or a white powder, neutral, odorless, bitter, deliquescent, soluble in water and alcohol. Dose, from one-tenth to one-half of
@ grain.

Physiological Action—The agent has a profound influence upon the
nerve centers, thence upon the heart. It quickens the pulse rate, increases
arterial tension, augments the force of the muscular contraction of the ventricles, and increases the movement of the blood through the arterioles. It
stimulates the action of the kidneys to a marked degree and produces mild
diaphoresis. In overdoses it produces muscular trembling, inco-ordination,
emesis, catharsis, and finally paralysis of the respiratory and motor centers.
The heart is stopped in systole.

Therapy—Sparteine is a remedy for weak heart with muscular feebleness, It is useful in palpitation from heart strain and exhaustion. It has
been used in Graves’ disease, and is thought to be of much value in this
trouble. Simple goitre also may be benefited by it. It produces its effects
quickly, and the influence remains for several hours. It is a diuretic, removing dropsical effusions which result from feebleness of the circulation. It
is not a remedy to be depended upon in all cases.

CAFFEINE.

Formula—C, H,, N, HO, 0,.

Synonym—Methyltheobromine.

Occurrence—The proximate principle obtained from dry tea leaves,
coffee, guarana sorbilis, and from some other plants.

Caffeine citrate is formed by the solution of caffeine in citric acid. It is
probably a mixture of the two substances and not a chemical compound. It
is a white powder, odorless, slightly bitter, and acid in reaction.

Mixed freely with water it is unstable and apt to precipitate. With
only three parts of water it forms a syrupy solution, more permanent. When
the precipitated liquid is increased by the addition of more than twentyfive parts of water, it will then remain in permanent solution.

Physiological Action—Caffeine acts upon the reflex centers of the spinal
cord. It increases the temperature at first, afterwards diminishing it. It
stimulates the cerebral functions, causing rapidity and facility of mental
action. It produces nervousness and wakefulness. It has no true tonic
effect. It raises the blood pressure and increases the pulse rate, acting as a
direct stimulant to the muscle of the heart. It increases the solids in the
urine by stimulating the epithelium of the tubules.

It actively stimulates the respiratory centers. This influence is required
where there has been marked depression of the nervous system, and where
motor depressants have been taken as poisons. It is given in conjunction
with morphine to prevent any after depressing effect of this agent on the
heart’s action. It is given in many cases of headache, the effervescent citrate
being a popular remedy, one used by the laity almost indiscriminately.

Therapy—Caffeine is a direct heart stimulant. It is given to support the
heart in extreme feebleness or threatened failure. It is given in conjunction
with remedies that are apt to have a depressing effect upon the heart, to
sustain it against such depression. In feeble heart from dilatation, valvular
insufficiency or fatty degenration, and in dropsy resulting from the above
conditions, with deficient capillary tonus, this agent is an excellent remedy.

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE HEART 227

In exhaustion from prostrating disease, with weak heart, this agent will
exercise a positive influence in the general restoration of the patient, through
its strengthening action on the heart.

It is given in some cases of asthma where there is exhaustion from
feebleness of the respiratory nerves.

It is given to dispel the drowsiness common to some individuals after
eating a hearty meal. It is a remedy for melancholia, hypochondriasis and
despondency.

It is a valuable remedy in general lithemic conditions, as it assists in
elimination of urea and uric acid.

The main objection to the use of the remedy in these conditions is its
inclination to produce persistent wakefulness. In extreme doses it sometimes produces a mild form of delirium, with palpitation, general tremor and
tinnitus aurium.

-It is important in uremic coma, which causes depression of the heart
and respiratory functions. It should be given hypodermically, in doses of
from one-eighth to one-half a grain. It may be used in conjunction with
other active eliminants.

Caffeine Citratis Effervescens—Effervescent citrate of caffeine. This
popular combination for the administration of caffeine is made by triturating together a hundred and fifty-four grains ¢ach of caffeine and citric acid,
eleven and a half ounces of bicarbonate of soda, ten and a half ounces of
tartaric acid and twelve ounces of sugar, finely powdered. After thorough
trituration, alcohol is added in sufficient quantity to make a soft paste. It
is rubbed through a No. 6 galvanized iron sieve, and when dried is reduced
to a coarse powder. It contains one per cent of caffeine. It is kept in a cool,
dry place, in well-stoppered bottles, and is given in teaspoonful doses dissolved in a glass of water. It is a most pleasant method of administration.
It is more commonly prescribed in the treatment of headaches, especially if
caused by an acid condition of the stomach.

In mild cases of palpitation of the heart of a functional character,
usually depending upon gastric derangement, this agent will be found advantageous.

APOCYNUM. APOCYNUM CANNABINUM.

Synonym—Canadian Hemp.

ConstITUENTS—Apocynin, apocynein, tannin, gallic acid, gum, starch,
resin, wax.

PreparaTions—Decoctum, Apocyni, Decoction of Apocynum. Dose, from
half a dram to one dram. Specific Medicine Apocynum. Dose, from half of a
minim to twenty minims.

Administration—It may be necessary to vary the form of the remedy in
its administration in certain cases before a marked result occurs. The specific apocynum seldom fails. It may act promptly in doses of from one-half
to one drop frequently repeated, and it may be necessary to give five drops
or more at a dose, but close watch must be kept on its action upon the bowels
that it be not too severe and prostrating. The agent has a general tonic influence which so sustains the body forces that considerable violence of
cathartic action can be obtained in some cases, without marked depression,
but usually this violent action should be avoided..

Fluid extracts are usually unreliable and uncertain in their action, some
acting promptly, others producing marked irritation and depression, and
still others being inert. If the fresh root of the apocynum can be obtained,
an infusion of one ounce to the pint of water may be made, and from a tea-

spoonful to a tablespoonful of this infusion given often and increased or
diminished as indicated. In some cases very small doses are very efficient.
A tincture carefully prepared from the fresh root sometimes is the superior
preparation.

While specific medicine apocynum and the normal tincture of apocynum
are both excellent forms of this remedy for administration, there are some
cases in which these produce considerable irritation of the stomach and intestinal canal. A distilled extract of apocynum is now supplied, which is
nearly tasteless; can be administered in larger doses, and in many cases produces more satisfactory results than any other form, as it has less irritating
properties. This fact is indeed important.

Physiological Action—Whether this agent acts most directly upon the
heart or upon the kidneys has been an unsettled question except to those who
have used it in cases where the heart was greatly enfeebled and relaxed, and
when dropsy resulted from that condition.

It is certainly an excellent heart tonic in such cases, improving the
strength of the heart muscle, the character and force of the pulse, and increasing to a most marked extent the arterial tonus. We have taken the initiative in introducing it among the specific heart remedies. It strengthens
the nerve force, improves the respiration, and facilitates oxidation of the
blood. Its influence is similar to convallaria or digitalis, and it acts in harmony with cactus, the influence of both being increased.

This agent is a violent cardiac poison. Given in large doses, it stops the
heart in complete systole, and in small doses slows the beats and strengthens
their force. It contains an active principle which acts as does digitalis, with,
however, these differences, that it is not cumulative, and when administered
in a medicinal dose it does not give rise to any inconvenience excepting some
headache. Froment has reported ten instances of diverse cardiac disease in
which the pulse was slowed, the rhythm was made regular, the arterial tension was raised, and edema disappeared; in certain cases it acted when
strophanthus and tincture of convallaria had failed. It seems to be useful
in certain febrile conditions where the frequency of the pulse gives rise to
anxiety, notably so in pulmonary tuberculosis, although a large dose may
increase the diarrhea if present.

Horatio C. Wood conducted independent experiments to determine the
physiological action of this remedy, under the auspices of the National
Academy of Science. His observations have confirmed my early and later
statements concerning the direct influence of apocynum upon the heart. He
states that, notwithstanding all early observations were made with reference
to the action of this drug upon the kidneys, his experiments prove that its
influence is directly upon the circulation. Injected into the veins of a dog,
there was a marked slowing of the pulse with a rise in the blood pressure,
usually, but in some cases the slowing of the pulse was so great and so immediate as to prevent any rise of blood pressure. These effects, he asserts,
are in every way similar to the action of digitalis, and he is impressed that
there is a marked similarity between the action of this drug and digitalis.

His experiments made to determine whether the stimulation was directly
upon the heart, or upon the circulation, through the vaso-motor mechanism,
convinced him that the drug stimulated the cardiac muscle directly, bringing
about a cessation of cardiac action, if persisted in, to over-stimulation, the
contractions of the heart ceasing in permanent systolic spasms. He believes
the remedy acts also upon the arterial walls. His studies further show that
despite the enormous stimulation of the heart, the circulation through the
kidneys is diminished rather than increased. This he attributes to a narrowing of the lumen of the blood vessels of the kidney.

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE HEART 229

He believes that the increased flow of urine under apocynum is due to
the regulation of the circulation at large, a condition similar to that induced
by digitalis. The pulse is slowed by the action of the remedy through stimulation of the cardiac inhibitory centers of the medulla.

His final conclusions are that apocynum is a powerful stimulant to the
circulation, and one of which great practical use can be made. However, because of its irritating action upon the stomach, he thinks its use will be limited, but we do away with this objection entirely, first by the administration
of the specific medicine in small doses and, second, by the use of the distilled
extract, as stated, which is devoid of irritating properties.

Felix-Kramer of Germany has made the following statements:

“The active principle of apocynum, according to Liebreich and Langaard, is a glucoside called apocynin, the action of which is, like that of
digitalis, a cardiac poison. Like strophanthus, nerum oleander, and vinca
minor, the plant belongs to the Apocynacee family.

The reports on this remedy so far as I have been able to follow them
are unanimous in designating it as a cardiac tonic and diuretic. According
to Gwovdinski, of Kiev, apocynum cannabinum is known in Virginia as a
household remedy and is used by some American physicians by preference
as a diuretic. The dose according to this report is 15 drops, t. i. d., and
given during the period of compensatory disturbance it caused no unpleasant
side-effects.

According to Alesejew the effect of the remedy appears, in proper cases,
in two or three days. If no remedial action appeared in five days Alesejew
made no further use of the remedy. He prescribed small doses (from three
to five drops) three to four times a day. After larger doses he met at times
gastric disturbances and pains in the cardiac region. Cumulative effects he
did not encounter. The dosage, according to Golubin, is five drops three or
four times daily. 5

In Pawinsky’s (of Warsaw) notices about apocynum cannabinum
the observations he made of the different effects of this remedy from those
of digitalis on the vagus are interesting. He found that apocynum cannabinum acts more readily and energetically on the innervation of the heart than
digitalis, but the effect of the latter is a more persistent one. He would,
therefore, use the remedy at shorter intervals, especially in cases of
arrhythmia,

His dosage is somewhat higher: Eight to ten drops of the fluid extract two to three times a day. However, one should always begin with
small doses. Pawinsky rarely met with unfavorable effects on the digestion
from this remedy, of which effects some authors speak very extensively.
Cumulative effects he found none.

The indications for the remedy, according to the writer mentioned,
are valvular lesions and affections of the heart muscle at the time of disturbance of compensation. A. Robin gave thirty drops of this remedy three
times daily.

Its influence upon the kidneys is exercised, however, when heart symptoms are not conspicuous. It produces a greatly increased flow of limpid
urine without irritating the kidneys. There is no hematuria or other evidence of forced action or marked renal congestion. In profound doses it
has caused suppression of the urine.

The agent exercises a hydragogue influence both upon the kidneys and
bowels. In large doses it irritates the stomach, producing violent prostrating emesis. As an emetic or cathartic it is too harsh and should not be
used. We have more efficient and milder remedies,

## Page 217

230 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Dr. Gregory believes apocynum acts directly on the kidneys and when
they are acting insufficiently he uses it as a stimulant, believing that it increases the solid matter thrown off. Dr. Moercke, of Burlington, believes. that the remedy will not act when dropsy is induced by malignant diseases,
but may perform miracles where the patient is dying from incurable heart
lesions with general dropsy. He finds it of great value in articular rheui when the tissues are filled with serum, and the heart weak but
sound,

The following conclusions were drawn by a writer in the Medical Century:
The drug may be given in large doses for a long time—several years
in a few cases—without injury to the patient.

Improvement soon manifests itself in the majority of cases, but if improvement does not appear soon after taking the drug its further administration will be of no avail.

The best way to give the drug is by starting in with small doses of the
tincture—three drops—and gradually increasing the dose so that the patient
is taking ten drops three times a day within three days.

Curative results have not been seen from its use, but the patient is made
comfortable and the amount of dropsy greatly diminished. ©

The only evil consequence from the use of the drug is a slight amount
of gastric irritation which is sometimes the result of its taking. This effect
gradually wears off as the patient becomes accustomed to its use.

Many failures have been reported, but the writer is inclined to believe that they are mostly due to the use of poor preparations. Beneficial
results have not been obtained from the use of the various homeopathic tinetures; many of them seem to be inert. The best results have been obtained
from the use of the eclectic specific medicine.

Specific Symptomatology—Dropsy is the condition for which this agent
should be used, with puffiness of the face beginning in the cellular tissues
around or under the eyes, puffiness of the hands and feet, followed by general dropsical effusion. Dropsy caused by defective kidney action yields
first, provided too much structural change of the kidneys has not occurred.

We would add, as specific symptoms, local edema; edema of the fect and
lower legs, pitting upon pressure; edema occurring suddenly from unexlained causes, especially when there is general atonicity, with more or less
eebleness of the heart’s action.

In acute inflammation of the kidneys, where dropsy appears before the
kidney lesion has been diagnosed, as often occurs in post-scarlatinal nephritis, it is prompt in its action, but the kidney inflammation must be combated with other remedies. In dropsy depending upon feeble heart, with
impaired blood pressure and deficient capillary action, the influence of
apocynum is fully as marked as in the above condition.

Therapy—The statements made in my first editions concerning the
therapeutic action of this remedy upon the heart have been more than confirmed by subsequent reports other than those of Wood. It acts in har
mony with cactus, which is the superior remedy, however, in its tonic effects
upon the nervous control of the heart and in improving its muscular power.

Apocynum improves the functional operation of the heart. Dr. Best reports two cases, where the heart was laboring tumultuously, with great irregularity. The radial pulse was almost imperceptible, except upon the
every third or fourth beat. All other heart remedies had been tried and
failed. This remedy accomplished all that could be desired. There was a
very great increase in the flow of urine, the pulse became stronger, the heart

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE HEART 281

turbulence and the dyspnea disappeared, and the patient recovered. Another patient, seventy-five years of age, with very irritable heart and conried cough, was relieved by the action of this remedy, in small, frequent
loses.

Apocynum strengthens the heart’s action, producing an increased tonicity and a regularity of movement, and stimulates the excretion of the watery
portion of the urine, changing this fluid from a scanty, thick, turbid liquid
to one normal, clear and free, rapidly reducing edema.

In the latter stages of heart diseases where hydropericardium is present, with other local or general effusions, it is prompt and efficient in its
action, as it most materially strengthens the heart and improves the character of the circulation, while it removes the effusion and consequent oppression.

In the later stages of pneumonia where cyanosis and difficult breathing,
with increased weakness of the heart, are threatening complications, Dr.
Wilkenloh depends upon apocynum. It increases the power of the heart,
improves capillary circulation, assists in overcoming hepatization, and acts
upon the kidneys at the same time. She gives from five to ten drops until it
loosens the action of the bowels. Then she reduces it to half a drop every
half hour or hour. She has confidence in it in cardiac dropsy. She gives it
for dropsy from arteriosclerosis, giving it in small doses with hypodermics
of strychnine. She thinks we have much yet to learn of its influence.

It has been used in all local dropsies. It has cured several cases of
hydrocephalus, and should be tried in these cases.

Cidema, accompanying a mild form of asthmatic breathing, with irregular heart’s action, has been cured, with all the symptoms, with this remedy.
The recent reports of the action of apocynum include the influence of the
remedy upon the heart. Dr. Winter believes that apocynum should be used
in cerebrospinal meningitis, especially after the stage of effusion. He believes it to be the rational remedy. It may be combined with the otner indicated remedies and echinacea. Dr. Shafer and other observers have used
it to settle the stomach and strengthen the heart during an attack of delirium tremens, or following a debauch. Its influence in the cases used was
very prompt and satisfactory. Dr. Keys confirms this observation.

In the nephritis of pregnancy with albuminuria, apocynum lessens arterial tension while it overcomes the dropsy and assists in the reduction of
blood pressure which in itself abates the quantity of albumin. If the pulse
is strong and rapid, this influence is enhanced by the careful use of veraIn females where there are greatly relaxed or flabby tissues,
and a tendency to metrorrhagia or menorrhagia, with some little effusion in
the ankles, with feeble kidney action, apocynum influences all the conditions. If iron be added for the anemia the influence will be prompt and satisfactory. It has considerable reputation in the control of passive hemorrhage among certain physicians.

Apocynum has cured many stubborn, intractable and very severe cases
of sciatica. We do not undertake to explain its action in this disease. Half
a dram of the specific apocynum added to four ounces of water, a teaspoonful every half hour, resulted in relief after a few doses. In the treatment
of this disorder Webb and others use five drops over the sheath of the nerve,
sometimes giving it from four to six times in a day, often with rapid results.
Any toxic effect must be watched for:

Harvey Brown adds three drams of apocynum to four ounces of water
and gives a teaspoonful every four hours for sciatica. ©

282 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Trowbridge has used apocynum in doses of two drops four times a day
where there is irregular and too frequent menstruation. In one case in his
special work as an oculist where there was exophthalmic goiter with nervous
irritability and irritable heart, he gave apocynum and this corrected all the
conditions as well as the irregular menstruation, which he thinks is present
in every female patient with this disorder. This suggestion should have attention.

From severe injury to the thigh, a patient of Dr. Neiderkorn developed
a condition closely resembling dropsy of the extremities, but described by him
with symptoms similar to acute traumatic phlebitis. The appearances so
closely resembled the indications for apocynum that he gave this remedy in
drop doses every two hours. There was a gradual reduction in the swelling,
and a satisfactory abatement of the inflammatory symptoms with early recovery.
The Removal of Dropsical Accumulations.

In the treatment of dropsy I am convinced that the physiological
processes involved have been misunderstood and therefore often wrongly
treated. Failures have been attributed to the remedy, when they have been
due to its improper administration. That this is too often the case in the
use of remedies for other conditions, I am assured.

To illustrate: Cathartics are administered for their hydrogogue action
in dropsy, either to directly reduce the quantity of the fluid within the tissues or to reduce the quantity of serum directly from the blood and thus
induce a reabsorption, perhaps, of the serum which has been diffused outside the capillaries throughout the tissues.

It is well known that apocynum, elaterium, and hair cap moss, when
given in proper dosage, will so influence the process of absorption that the
diffused serum will be taken back through the medium of the capillaries,
into the circulation and the dropsy will disappear without any active hydrogogue or diuretic action. ~

first made this observation in 1882, of the action of hair cap moss.
Both my own observations and those of other more recent writers will confirm this influence as being possible from the use of apocynum, elaterium,
magnesium sulphate in small and frequently repeated doses, and one or two
other remedies to a limited extent. Whether the remedy acts through its direct influence upon the heart, and the circulation of the blood, or upon the
secretory or excretory glands of the intestinal canal, as elaterium is supposed to act, or upon both these processes, as apocynum acts, or primarily
upon the kidneys, there is no doubt in my mind that an influence is exercised upon the blood pressure—upon arterial tension and perhaps also upon
the specific gravity of the blood which influences absorption and the osmotic
processes, promoting a reabsorption of the diffused serum into the capillaries
without any apparent loss of fluid by increased intestinal, renal, or other
eliminative action.

If it were possible to know how this reabsorption could be always induced, it would be of great advantage, as it at once restores the quantity of
fluid to the circulation, and prevents the prostration and debilitation of the
patient, present, often after the removal of so great a quantity of fluid, which
sometimes results in the death of the patient, before the influence of restoratives can be administered. I regret that I cannot give the dosage, exact in
each case, but it is small always, usually much less than the commonly prescribed dose, and the dose should be frequently repeated. With apocynum
this may be observed with twenty drops of the specific medicine in four
ounces of water, a teaspoonful given every hour. With elaterium from onethirtieth to one-fortieth of a grain should be given every hour. The fact that

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE HEART 283

there is no prostration, that the patient’s strength and vital forces are retained by this process, is a strong argument in favor of a knowledge of it,
and of its adaption. We must look for this influence with other remedies.

ANHALONIUM. ANHALONIUM LEWINI.

This agent, one of the small cacti of Mexico, has been recommended for
certain special conditions as an important heart remedy. It seems to act directly upon the nerve centers in a manner much like aconite, reducing the
force and frequency of the pulse. If continued too far, its influence is that of
& general depressant.

One writer claims that anhalonium resembles aconite in its action first, but
immediately the symptoms are similar to the influence of belladonna. There
then follows a general soothing influence with an inclination to sleep. It is
advised as especially valuable where there is a tendency to nervous debility,
or where failure for those who labor under great stress of pain, or those who
from extensive stress of business or extravagant use of tobacco
are troubled with sleeplessness, or those who are reduced in their
mental power, or suffer from loss of memory. No careful, general
or exhaustive observation has been made concerning its action. It has
been used in angina pectoris, asthma or acute asthmatic dyspnea or dyspnea
from cardiac feebleness, and in pneumothorax, it has produced good results.
Cactus is a special sedative under certain circumstances, and this agent
promises to be as good. It has a direct action on the feeble, irregular and intermittent heart. It deserves careful investigation in those lines in which
cactus exercises its therapeutic influence.

A writer in the Medical World suggests five drops of anhalonium three
times a day in the treatment of diabetes. It produces free, regular, and deep
breathing, assisting the respiration. It improves the functional activity of
the heart by improving its tonicity. It thus acts similar to cactus.

ADONIS. ADONIS VERNALIS.

Synonyms—Adonis Apennina, Pheasant’s eye.

Preparations—Adonidin. Dose, 1/10 from to 1/3 grain.

Fluid Extract of Adonis Vernalis; miscible in water without material
precipitation. Dose, one to two minims.

Specific Medicine Adonis. Dose, from one-fourth of a minim to one
minim. It is usually prescribed: ten drops in four ounces of water, a teaspoonful every two hours.

Adonidin—The constituents of adonis were studied by Cervello, who obtained from it only one active substance, which he named ‘‘Adonidin.’’ This
substance is extremely energetic and seems to be present only in small proportion. It is a non-nitrogenous, colorless, odorless and extremely bitter
amorphous powder.

Physiological Action—From a careful clinical and physiological study
of the effects of adonis vernalis, Dr. Budnow concludes that the active principle excites the inhibitory nerves in the heart at the central end; that its
further action is to paralyze the peripheral end of the vagus; that it likewise
excites the accelerator nerves, sometimes directly (through the blood pressure), sometimes indirectly; that at the moment of the vagal paralysis, the
two systems of cardiac innervation interfere; that at the termination of the


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 221

284 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

toxic effect, paralysis of the motor nervous apparatus of the heart occurs;
that after death there is either complete loss of excitability or the cardiac
muscle is very much weakened.

Durand sums up his observations as follows: In doses of 1/3 grain
Adonidin increases arterial tension, regulates the heart beat, diminishes the
frequency of the pulse, increases the force of the cardiac contractions. Acting with rapidity, its effect being present only during administration increases diuresis, is well tolerated, but increased doses irritate the stomach.

He commends its use especially in mitral insufficiency and interstitial
myocarditis, and in palpitation of the heart.

Therapy—Adonis is indicated in chronic weak heart where the venous
circulation is engorged, and where there is a tendency to varicosed ulcers. In
functional heart disorders with weakness, the agent is contraindicated.

In the treatment of varicosis, one writer advises it in small doses persisted in.

The agent is of value in those conditions which result from imperfect
arterial tension, due to incompetent heart action. It is useful in many cases
of dropsy, especially if the kidneys are inefficient in their action. It contracts the enfeebled and dilated heart muscle and improves its tone. In general dropsy its influence is quite as satisfactory as that of the other heart
remedies, probably, however, not more so than digitalis, although its diuretic
influence is sometimes great. In those cases in which digitalis fails to produce diuresis, the diuretic influence of adonis vernalis is more constant. It
is valuable in irregularity of the heart and in dyspnea from feeble heart. It
is also serviceable in dyspnea from asthma with cardiacal feebleness. It has
produced marked results in these cases.

It has been advised by some prominent authorities in the treatment of
epilepsy. The following formula has been suggested: Forty grains are dissolved in five ounces of water and filtered. To this are added 160 grains of
potassium bromide and three grains of caffeine. A teaspoonful of this four
ae daily has cured some stubborn cases. The agent is often given in in-

‘usion.

IBERIS. IBERIS AMARA.

Synonym—Bitter Candytuft.

PREPARATIONS—The powdered plant. Dose from one to three grains.
Tinctura Iberis Amare. Dose, five drops, increased or decreased as indicated.

ConstTITUENT—Lepiden, a bitter principle.

Therapy—The most direct action of this remedy is upon an enlarged
heart, where there is functional weakness. It lessens the force of the heart’s
action, controlling violence and irritability. It overcomes the dyspnea of
these cases, the vertigo and general sense of weakness, with other reflex
symptoms.

In bronchitis, asthma, dyspnoea, and in jaundice or dropsy, all of cardiac
origin, it is said to be one of our best agents, in some cases acting magically.
Galen used it in rheumatic affections. The agent has not received the attention it is said to deserve.

GROUP III.

Agents Acting Upon the Respiratory Tract.


Nauseating Expectorants and Respiratory Sedatives.

LOBELIA. IPECAC. GRINDELIA.
SANGUINARIA. SQUILLS. QUEBRACHO.
LOBELIA, LOBELIA INFLATA.

Note—In the early editions of my work on Materia Medica, this agent
was classed from our knowledge of its action per os, as a nauseating expectorant and respiratory sedative. Since that time, the very wide observations
made of its action hypédermically have changed the most of our ideas concerning it, and have placed it in an entirely different class. Given hypodermically but very few patients are nauseated by it, and almost the whole
number, notwithstanding its sedative and anti-spasmodic influence, experience a physical uplift from its action. It would seem therefore to be more
properly classed among stimulants. I have thought best, however, to leave
this agent in its original class, until laboratory experiments have proven its
exact influence upon the nervous and circulatory systems.

Synonym—Indian Tobacco.

Part Employed—The whole plant.

Natural Order—Lobeliaceae.

Locality—North America.

ConstrrvEnts—Lobeline, Lobelachrin, Lobelia acid.

PrEPARATIONS—Extractum Lobeliae Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Lobelia;
dose, from one to ten minims.

Tinctura Lobeliae, Tincture of Lobelia; dose, from five to thirty minims.

Specific Medicine Lobelia; dose, from one to twenty minims.

Subeculoid (hypodermic) Lobelia; dose, from two to sixty minims;
usually from ten or thirty minims repeated as occasion demands.

The preparation of lobelia which is to be used hypodermically, must be
selected with great care. If the agent be given internally, any good fluid
preparation is effective, but in its hypodermic use, local irritation, nausea,
severe vomiting, even general prostration occur more frequently from the
ordinary fluid preparations. If depression with the above complications
can be properly antagonized, and is not objectional in a sthenic patient. and
the case immediately demands the remedy when only these are at hand, much
the same results will occur as from the perfected preparations.

Extended and persistent experimentation has been made to secure as
nearly as possible a perfect fluid preparation for hypodermic use. The nearest to this at the present time is the so-called Subculoid lobelia. This is
devoid to a very large extent of the objectionable features of the other preparations, and so nearly devoid of emetic properties that this is now considered a negligible quality. It is always best however to use any preparation
hypodermically warmed, the parts aseptic, and to apply a hot compress over
the seat of the application immediately for a few minutes. Except for its
local effects, there is but little difference between the Subculoid lobelia and
the specific medicine lobelia.

236 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Administration—Given by mouth for the various purposes for which it
has long been used, the dosage of the specific medicine should be small, and
frequently repeated. As an emetic or antispasmodic, the dose is from fifteen
to thirty minims. Given hypodermically, from five to fifteen drops is usually
sufficient in all children’s cases, and from ten to thirty drops in adult cases.
If no untoward results occur after the first dose, and the condition demands
it, a more or less frequent dose and an increase in the size of the dose is justified by the severity of the symptoms, and by the demand for its influence.

Every prescriber will soon learn to make these adjustments correctly. In
an occasional case a very small dose is sufficient.

Physiological Action—Lobelia relieves pain due to spasm of any character. But in its antispasmodic and relaxing influence it is not narcotic in the
same sense as opium. It exercises a soothing influence over nerve irritability,
and a distinct anodyne result ensues. General relief from pain often follows when other measures have failed. The pain from renal or hepatic stone
is more quickly relieved by it and more permanently, often, than by morphine because of the general relaxation.

As used by the mouth, prior to our knowledge of its peculiar action hypodermically, it was determined that lobelia in toxic doses causes extreme
prostration, burning pain in the esophagus, rapid, feeble pulse, fall of temperature, collapse, coma or convulsions and death from respiratory failure.
Moderate doses cause dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache and general
tremors. In doses of twenty grains it is a prompt emetic, but emesis is
accompanied by excessive prostration, relaxation and a feeble pulse. In
small doses it causes increased expectoration and diaphoresis. Like other
narcotics, a small dose stimulates, while a large dose depresses the nervous
system.

Although usually classed among emetics, lobelia is a nerve sedative of
great power, and in this influence as an antispasmodic it is exceeded by but
few remedies.

Death has occurred in a very few cases from excessive doses of the remedy, but toxic effects are not apparent where the medicinal dose is prescribed. Where death has occurred, its influence as a nerve depressant has
been plainly shown in the profound, general muscular relaxation, with
greatly impaired muscular power, general trembling, shallow respiration,
cold, clammy skin, feeble and depressed heart action. It acts like tobacco
and physostigma upon the respiration, the heart’s action continuing after
the respiration has ceased. Paralysis of the respiratory nerves is its prominent influence,

The observations made of its physiological action when the remedy is used
hypodermically are, that so used, the direct local influence of the agent upon the stomach is avoided and if the remedy is properly prepared, emesis,
violent vomiting, profound relaxation, with prostration and depression,
which were found present from that local influence are all absent. A total
of less than five per cent of the cases will show emesis or even nausea.

Used in a medicinal dose, it softens the pulse, slows the respiration,
quiets the nervous system, and produces a freedom of the respiration and
circulation. One of our writers claims that he believes that the agent introduced by the stomach acts upon the pneumogastric nerve, while, when introduced hypodermically and absorbed, it acts more directly upon the sympathetic nervous system.

Lobelia acts directly upon the regulating centers of the system; those
of heat, of the circulation, of nerve influences, both motor and sensory. It
supports the heart; it overcomes excessive blood pressure, and restores normal tension. It is directly indicated in depression as well as in over-stimu-

lation. It also controls hyperemia. Whatever the cause of any great depression, we cannot yet define the marvelous improvement observed from this
agent. We hardly call it stimulation, and yet the improved condition is
such as would ultimately follow the action of the very best, most natural
stimulants or tonics.

It is hard indeed to express the apparently contradictory influence exercised on the above named depression, which has been overcome in its most
extreme form—(in fact, in some cases where the skin was so cold and the
process of life so feeble as to cause one to think that death had occurred,
and yet the reaction appears very promptly)—between this condition and
its influence in profound heat stroke, as one doctor reports, where the temperature was 110 degrees, and others have reported from 106 degrees and
up. Dr. Jentzsch who is enthusiastic about the action of this remedy in heat
stroke, hesitates in claiming that lobelia is a stimulant, pure and simple, as
we understand the action of stimulants. Unlike brandy or strychnine or
digitalis, the immediate and sharp, stimulating, or whipping-up effects do
not appear in the same way to be lost when the effect of the medicine is
gone.

The improvement on all conditions is plainly marked, but the restoration is nearly that of a full normal condition obtained in a smooth and satisfactory manner. It is more like an increase of vital force, which remains
to a large extent, in the improved condition of all the functions after the
remedy has had time to be fully eliminated.

From my own personal observations and from the conclusions I have
drawn from the observations of others, I would say that lobelia seems at
once to supply a subtle but wholly sufficient force, power, or renewed vital
influence, by which the nervous system and the essential vital force within
the system again reassert themselves and obtain complete control of the
functional action of every organ. From this influence, in a natural and sufiicient manner, a complete harmonious operation of the whole combined forces
is at once resumed, in some cases in an almost startling manner. Other
agents stimulate, prop up, whip up or temporarily increase the force and
power of one or another function, while this remedy with this peculiar power
at once assumes control of the whole, and succeeds against all the opposing
influences.

Specific Symptomatology—This remedy is specific given in irritable,
spasmodic and oppressed breathing, and in respiratory disorders from exalted nerve force and nerve irritation.

It is contraindicated in general relaxation and in dyspnea from enlarged
or fatty heart, or from hydropericardium, or enfeebled heart, with valvular
incompetence. It is specific in threatened spasm with exalted nerve action
—a high dogree of nerve tension with great restlessness and excitability,
flushed face and contracted pupils. It is a prompt emetic in full doses. The
following observations are made almost entirely from its hypodermic use.

Therapy—In spasmodic asthma, if given in a dose of from thirty minims
to one dram during the paroxysm, the benefit is apparent almost immediately. Small doses are of but little or no benefit in such a case. This full
dose may be once repeated, but this is seldom necessary, and a single dose
seldom produces vomiting. It is useful in asthmatic breathing. When continued with other agents it must be given in doses not to exceed ten minims
three or four times a day.

Lobelia is of value in whooping-cough. It is a reliable expectorant, and
either alone or in combination with other indicated remedies, is useful in all
eases of dry, hard, barking cough, or where the expectoration is difficult to
raise, in spasmodic croup, and in membranous croup without depression.

Children are less liable to be unpleasantly affected with Lobelia than
adults.

Its action as an emetic is most profound. It is not so commonly used at
the present time for that purpose as ipecac, as the irritation, nausea and general depression are usually greater than is necessary.

It resembles tobacco in this and in many other particulars, producing
a burning sensation in the fauces which is persistent and unpleasant.

Either alone or combined with tincture of capsicum, it has long been
used to overcome spasms of all characters, from infantile convulsions to
puerperal eclampsia and epilepsy.

It has been given in tetanus with benefit, and with success in the spasms
of hydrophobia and of strychnia poisoning.

Because of the great importance placed upon this remedy by Thompson,
and the violent opposition which followed his endorsement, it has been openly
decried by the profession at large, and denounced because of its inactivity
in small doses, and declared to be a profound poison in full doses. If it had
been given fearlessly in full, large, single doses, the best of results would
have occurred.

As a remedy for hysteria, hysterical paroxysms and hysterical convulsions, the combined tinctures of this remedy and capsicum have no superior.
It will immediately terminate many paroxysms and quickly control convulsive attacks.

This agent has in the past been exceedingly popular as a relaxant in
rigid os uteri. Very many cases are on record of almost immediate relaxation and rapid termination of labor.

Ten years ago Dr. Ernst Jentzsch, sitting one night at the bedside of his
only son in the throes of death, from fulminating diphtheria, after antitoxin
to the extreme limit had been used, and all other available measures, claims
that in answer to prayer, with a peculiar confidence that he could not account for, gave the boy, without any precedent, a hypodermic injection of
one-half dram of specific medicine, lobelia. He made the following statement
as to results:

‘All the fatal symptoms gave way to those of returning health, the
patient passing from a death struggle into a peaceful slumber, from which
he awoke after three hours, somewhat weak. Another dose was given,
which was followed by a still more pronounced reaction for the better. The
patient from that time continued to convalesce, and, with the exception of
a post-diphtheritic pharyngeal paralysis, he made a rapid recovery. Later,
the paralysis yielded to smaller doses of the same remedy.’’

"(In any case where there is the least suspicion of diphtheria not always
waiting for a test, I give a half dram dose of the specific medicine lobelia
hypodermically, and repeat it from two to twelve hours once or oftener,
as indicated, until reaction sets in, which means a return to health.’’

In Diphtheria, lobelia has now been tested in several thousand cases.
At first there was some doubt from the reports received, but later and more
recently reports are quite uniformly favorable in encouraging the belief that
it will be found to be fully as useful a remedy as the serum antitoxin. It
has several advantages. It not only removes the membranes, but it destroys
the germs of disease, and at once puts the patient in the best possible physieal condition to resist its inroads. It preserves intact the functions of the
body, and preserves or restores the functions of the nervous system. It
is nontoxic, has not only no anaphylaxis following, but a single dose restores
a patient suffering from anaphylaxis from the serum antitoxin. The latest
report at this writing received found nine children in a hovel with no care,
all with diphtheria and only one with the disease mildly. Using nothing

whatever except lobelia, the physician lost one case out of the nine, putting
them, however, into as good condition as possible in their surroundings from
the beginning of his treatment.

The dose for diphtheria varies from ten minims to forty, and is administered according to the demands of the patient from one hour at first to six
hour intervals, with one or two injections a day for any subsequent paralysis.

Lobelia has long been used in asthma. Taken by the mouth severe
spasmodic cases are relieved. Hypodermically the same results are obtained.
An occasional case however will show unfavorable results, and in some cases
where there are serious heart lesions, there has been prostration, depression,
and threatened death which were combated only by vigorous measures. The
smaller dose should be used in these cases until no evidence of idiosyncrasy
or susceptibility are known to occur. In the absence of these indications
then the agent can be used fearlessly and in increasing doses if necessary.

This agent is equally satisfactorily in the treatment of diphtheritic—membranous—croup. The observations have been universally favorable. Simple
spasmodic croup yields to it promptly. As yet no undesirable results are
reported. The dose is from five to fifteen minims, repeated as needed.

In the treatment of tonsillitis, it will not be needed except in the severer
forms, in which it will promote satisfactory results.

In the treatment of coughs, those due to pneumogastric irritation, are
quickly relieved as well as the pain accompanying. It promotes normal expectoration and respiratory freedom.

In the treatment of whooping cough, but few cases are reported at this
time, but the suggestion is that it be given just preceding the attack of
cough and repeated if possible on two or three consecutive attacks.

In the treatment of bronchial coughs and acute bronchitis, especially if
the bronchial tubes are loaded with mucus and there is a sense of tightness
with some difficulty in breathing, the agent is directly indicated.

If with pneumonia or broncho-pneumonia, there should be rapid shallow
breathing with anxious expression of the countenance and a tendency to cyanosis, this agent is clearly indicated. It improves the heart’s action; relieves
the capillary circulation, and dissipates cyanosis, more quickly than any
other remedy.

It is well known that in the treatment of pneumonia in the later stages,
symptoms occur frequently which seem to threaten an almost immediate
fatal termination. This group of symptoms is promptly met with a single
hypodermic dose of lobelia. This is especially true with children. I have
many reports where the agent snatched the little patient as it were, from
the grave, just as death’s door seemed to be closing upon it.

When from any cause, usually from heart complications, the patient
complains of shortness of breath, especially if there be any sense of oppression in the chest, or tightness around the chest, a medium dose of lobelia
hypodermically will give full freedom and in many cases a careful properly
timed repetition of the injection will give permanent relief.

In the treatment of nausea, persistent vomiting, and a generally disturbed condition of the stomach, if ten drops of lobelia be added to half a
glass of water and a teaspoonful be given by the mouth every ten or fifteen
minutes, it will often give prompt relief.

It is also useful adjusted in the same manner as the above for sick headaches and given over a period of time with reference to the conditions that
induce the disease and also to any possible periodical recurrence of the disease, it will be found curative.

It was used successfully in one case of persistent hiccough. One-half
dram repeated in half an hour cured the case.

In the treatment of acute spasm in the stomach, in the pylorus or cardiospasm, this agent is of immediate benefit. It is exceedingly beneficial in
spasms of any kind within the abdomen. Some obstinate cases having been
cured with it. It quickly relieves certain cases of chronic constipation, and
is positively indicated in obstipation and where the obstruction of the bowels
ae certain. It thoroughly relaxes muscular spasm and encourages peristalsis.

Used in acute heart failure with imminent danger, a full injection is demanded. Many lives have been saved by its peculiar sustaining influence.
No depression is observed, no erratic action, even when what would seem to
be unnecessarily large doses have been given. One to two drams have been
frequently given and repeated with only good results. In these cases indications for other remedies should be looked for and met.

Heart conditions depending upon feebleness or lack of tone or of muscular power should have occasional regular doses of this agent. It can be
given with more freedom than any other heart stimulant. A case of tachycardia is reported where it was used with temporary benefit only.

In chronic heart disease with dilatation—hypertrophy—the consequent
valvular deficiency and other structural defects, the agent must be given
with caution as in a few cases untoward results have been seen.

The prompt and satisfactory effect of lobelia upon angina pectoris has
been known for fifty years or more, the old prescribers giving it by the mouth
freely and with positiveness for this disorder. Hypodermically the agent
is given in about thirty drop doses but in many cases fifteen drops have been
sufficient. Usually the larger the dose the more satisfactory the result.

In precordial oppression, where the patient complains of a sensation of
tightness over the chest with sighing respiration—a sensation of weight,
eae and tightness, often accompanied with considerable pain, it is indicated. -

In the treatment of any form of hysteria, especially if there be violent
He excitement or convulsions, this agent will be found of immediate

enefit.

Its natural antispasmodic properties make it a most reliable remedy
for convulsions of any form and by proper adjustment, it is the safest probably of our agents for the convulsions of childhood. In babes, a small dose
only is required and there is little danger of nausea or other unpleasant
effects. The dose should be repeated as needed.

Spasm of the glottis has been controlled in several cases promptly with
ten drop doses, though a larger dose may be needed.

A case of tonic spasm with deep coma following a fifth laparotomy was
most satisfactorily cured by dram doses every fifteen or twenty minutes until
two ounces were used.

The convulsions of cerebrospinal meningitis have no more active antidote than hypodermic lobelia. Given with echinacea, calcium sulphide or
hexymethylenamine, it will prove curative, although some doctors will prefer to combine it, for sedative influence with gelsemium.

Dr. Wilkenloh has observed that she gets best results in this disease
when the face is ashy pale, when the muscular pains are extremely severe,
and where there is some paralysis following the convulsive attack. Even in
children with these conditions she gives full doses in most cases though
usually smaller doses will accomplish the same result.;

Five cases of epidemic spinal meningitis were treated with recovery in
every case with ten drop doses given every hour..

Epilepsy should be treated with this remedy and careful observations
made. If given during the aura in sufficiently large doses and the dose re-

peated as indicated, it will probably be found to exercise an efficient control.
It was satisfactory in a few cases that are reported, but observations are
insufficient.

In the treatment of tetanus, it has controlled the convulsions in a number of cases, especially if an anti-toxic agent was injected at the same time.

In the treatment of eclampsia, while our present anti-spasmodics are
efficient their influence is enforced by hypodermics of lobelia. It is the most
active of this class in promoting dilatation of a rigid os, which is often immediately essential, permitting the completion of the labor. It can be used
in conjunction or alternation with veratrum or gelsemium, and dram doses
of echinacea should be given by the mouth every two hours to antagonize
the toxins. One extreme case is reported with every condition aggravated
and these complicated with placenta previe. The child was removed by
Caesarian section. After veratrine, pilocarpine, elaterium, and magnesium
sulphate were given fully for the dropsy, the convulsions persisted even in
spite of prolonged anesthesia until thirty drop doses of lobelia were repeated,
frequently, when the whole was controlled, and the patient saved. Echinacea
was given for the extreme infection.

For rigidity of the os uteri at any time, it may be used. It promotes
normal uterine contraction after the os is dilated. A case of persistent absolute rigidity for thirty-six hours was dilated fully in four hours with this
agent.

A child thoroughly poisoned with strychnine was saved by thirty drop
doses repeated every half hour. He had eaten one-third of a grain. Another
case is reported where the agent successfully antagonized over-doses of
strychnine.

In every case of ptomaine poisoning, in which the agent has been used,
it has covered all the indications and has proved fully successful. It has
been used in many instances.

In one case where toad stools were eaten instead of mushrooms seven
individuals were thoroughly poisoned. One woman was very near death
when the first injection was given. All were saved very promptly by the
persistent and repeated use of full doses of this remedy. In many instances
when the dose was given, the immediate effect was plainly apparent.

Three or four cases of cerebral concussion have been reported where the
patients were unconscious. In one case consciousness was restored three
consecutive times, the patient and friends refusing an operation which was
plainly demanded for the compression made by the broken skull.

A number of cases of syncope from apoplexy were satisfactorily relieved
and the paralysis when present was benefited, to an extent, by the use of
this remedy.:

Asphyxia from any cause indicates Subculoid Lobelia. It should prove
of excellent benefit in restoring patients from drowning. Those who have
used it to restore patients from the dangerous effects of anesthetics keep it
constantly at hand for this purpose.

Favorable results are reported in two cases where patients were
threatened with hydrophobia. There was one test case in which the patient
bitten treated as above, showed no signs of hydrophobia while all the animals bitten by the same dog, developed the disease in fatal form.

A remarkable case is reported where a patient would indulge in an
occasional alcoholic debauch. At such a time he became unconscious and
remained so for four hours. This case was threatened with heart complications of a serious character. The condition was relieved in half an hour by
an injection of lobelia. In another case consciousness was restored by this
agent

In all forms of calculi where the pain is extreme, lobelia must be given
in full free doses. One or two repetitions will be all that are necessary.

In strangulated hernia, it is used with superior results. One case of
umbilical hernia yielded to it quickly.

In the treatment of malaria, it can be adjusted to assist the antiperiodics if given before the expected paroxysm. Several cases of pernicious
congestive chill have been restored by its prompt and sufficient use.

In general uremic poisoning, it should be given. In scarlet fever, especially severe cases, it acts promptly and in line with its indications will meet
the expectation of the prescriber.

In cases of obstinate constipation or obstipation, it has produced such
relaxation that the obstacles were quickly removed.

It has been given where there was extreme albuminuria in which it supported the strength of the patient until other measures could be used.

Lobelia has been given in full doses in cases of profound anuria, three
doses of from twenty to forty minims having been sufficient.

SANGUINARIA. SANGUINARIA CANADENSIS.

Synonym—Bloodroot.

ConstiTvUeNTs—Sanguinarine, chelerythrine, protopine, citric and malic
acids. Dose: Its best medicinal influence is obtained from small doses; from
ten to twenty drops in a four ounce mixture, a teaspoonful every hour or two.

Physiological Action—In excessive doses bloodroot is a gastric irritant,
and a depressant; it produces burning and racking pains in the digestive
from the mouth to the stomach; insatiable thirst, dilated pupils, nausea, an
anxious countenance, coldness of the extremities, cold sweats and more or less
diminution of the pulse, with irregularity.

Specific Symptomatology—The influence of sanguinaria is restricted to
rather narrow lines. In harsh, dry cough with relaxed tissues of the pharynx,
larynx and bronchi, with a sense of constriction and constant irritation and uneasiness or tickling in the throat, this agent is useful.

Therapy—It is a tonic and stimulant to the bronchial membranes. It
stimulates the capillaries and overcomes congestion of the lung structure,
after a severe cold in the chest from exposure. An improvised syrup made
from adding a dram of the tincture of sanguinaria and two drams of vinegar to two ounces of simple syrup will relieve the chest sensations quickly if
taken in teaspoonful doses every half hour or hour.

It is not as useful a remedy in diseases of children as ipecac or lobelia, as
the harshness of its action in full doses is not well borne. If combined with
either of these agents, and given in small doses for exactly the same purposes
for which they are suggested, it will furnish the tonic and stimulant influence
of the combination. There will be less nausea from the ipecac and less general
relaxation from lobelia. Given with the syrup of ipecac in hoarse bronchial
coughs, or stridulous laryngitis, or in the early stage of croup, it will enhance the expectorant influence of ipecac, and prevent, in part, the cold skin
and depressing influence of that agent. It equalizes the circulation of the entire
system, inducing warmth in the skin and in the extremities.

In membranous croup its use is an excellent auxiliary to the treatment,
but it is not to be depended upon alone. It may be given in small doses, not
sufficient to produce emesis, until the membrane is separated, then the dose may
be increased until the membrane is removed.

_ _ It_is a good remedy in atonic conditions of the lungs or bronchi with
imperfect circulation and relaxed mucous membranes, with general inactivity

of the nervous system and lack of nerve foree. It should not be prescribed during active inflammation, but will be of service when the more acute symptoms
have abated.

It will assist in overcoming hepatization of lung structure and restoring
normal tone and normal functional action. The powdered drug in small
doses in a capsule, may be combined with hydrastis or quinine with excellent
effect when those agents are indicated as restoratives.

It is said to act upon the stomach, liver and portal circulation, as a stimulant, and to the glandular organs and structures of the intestinal canal, and to
exercise an alterative influence within the blood.

The tincture in full doses, is an emmenagogue, restoring the menses
when suppressed from cold. It is not to be given if menstrual deficiency is
due to anemia, although it is tonic and stimulant in its influence upon the
reproductive organs.

The powdered sanguinaria is applicable to suppurative conditions. It is
useful in otitis media and in ozena.

The nitrate of sanguinaria is a soluble salt, as useful and leas irritating
than any other form of sanguinaria. It is valuable as a local application to
indolent ulcerative conditions. It should be used in small quantity in ointments, or in solution as a lotion. It is serviceable in chronic nasal cat
in chronic ulcerations of the throat, and in fissures and ulcerations of the
anus. It will act in this concentrated form as an escharotic and is of much
service as an application to epithelioma, lupus and to other growths of a
similar nature.

IPECAC. CEPHAELIS IPECACUANHA.

Synonym—Ipecacuanha.

ConstiTUENTS—Emetine. the emetic principle existing in the stem, leaves
and root, cholin and cephaeline in the root, ipecacuanhic acid, and a nauseating
ethereal oil.

PrePaRATIONS—Extractum Ipecac Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Ipecac;
dose, from one to forty minims.

Syrupus Ipecac, Syrup of Ipecac; dose, from ten to sixty minims.

Pulv. Ipecac et Opii, Powder of Ipecac and Opium, composed of Ipecac
and opium of each ten parts, Sugar of Milk, eighty parts; dose, from three to
ten grains.
Specific Medicine Ipecac; dose, for gastric, intestinal or bronchial irritation, five drops in four ounces of water; a tablespoonful every hour. As an
emetic, from five to twenty minims in hot water.

Alcresta Ipecac is prepared by the action of Lloyd’s reagent on the solution of the alkaloids of ipecac. It represents the medicinal properties of
the ipecac, but will not produce nausea or emesis. It is superior to emetine
in its general use because it is not hypodermic. One tablet represents ten
grains of the powdered ipecac. It may be given in doses of one, two or three
tablets three times per day, before meals.

Physiological Action of Ipecac, (J. U. Lloyd, Ph.D., LL.D., Ph. M., Western Druggist).—Ipecacuanha root, from its first appearance in our materia
medica, has been prized as an emetic and anti-dysenteric remedy.

The peculiar effect that the dust of ipecacuanha powder exerts upon the
respiratory organs of some persons has been noted by early observers. Lewis,
in 1761, makes the following statement: ‘‘Geoffroy observed that in pulverizing considerable quantities, the finer powder that flies off, unless great care be
taken to avoid it, is apt to afflict the operator with difficulty of breathing, spitting of blood and bleeding at the nose, or swelling and inflammation of the eyes

and face, and sometimes of the throat, adding that these symptoms disappear in
a few days, usually spontaneously. Poisoning in this manner may be
treated by blood-letting and the taking of a decoction of uva ursi and extract
of rhatany; in another more recent instance, relief was afforded by a dose of
extract of quebracho.

Powdered ipecac applied to the skin produces irritation and redness, followed finally by small isolated pustules, which increase in size to small
ulcers.

The powdered ipecac in one-sixth of a grain doses is a stomachic tonic,
stimulating the salivary and gastric secretions. In doses of ten grains it will
act as a nauseating emetic, but the emesis occurs slowly and is not extreme,
persistent nor prostrating like that of lobelia or tartar emetic.

In some cases continued repetition of the emetic dose produces a toleration,
when the emetic effect ceases, but there is diarrhea—an active cathartic influence, with stools characteristic of this agent. In some children the persistent
use of the syrup of ipecac will invariably produce diarrhea often persistent
and difficult to cure.

The agent is also diaphoretic and actively expectorant.

Specific Symptomatology—Persistent irritation in mucous membranes,
with deficient secretion, demand ipecac in small doses.

Persistent nausea and vomiting, with pale, relaxed membranes, whitecoated, broad tongue, will often yield most readily to minute doses (1-10 of a
drop) frequently repeated.

Bronchial gastric or intestinal irritations are benefited by its use. It is
indicated also in croup, with sudden dyspnoea and threatening suffocation,
extreme secretion, without ability to dislodge. A half teaspoonful of the syrup
will sometimes give immediate relief.,

Emetine was first isolated as the emetic principle of ipecac in 1867. In
1894 the other alkaloid cephaeline was discovered. In 1912 it was determined
that emetine destroyed the ameba which has been known to be the cause of
epidemic amebic dysentery, of a form of hepatitis, and also as the cause of
pyorrhea, commonly called Rigg’s disease, and other conditions of less im-. portance, This important discovery has placed this alkaloid (like the hypodermic use of lobelia has placed that important remedy) in a most conspicuous position, making it at once a specific for the conditions named. Alcresta
ipecac is exercising the same specific influence.

Dr. H. Barlow, Chief Surgeon to the Hospital at Cuyamel, Honduras,
now using these preparations, says: ‘‘My impressions are that while Alcresta ipecac cannot replace emetine in cases which can be seen daily, or in
severe cases, it has certain uses in which it is superior to emetine. These
are: 1. Cases in which there is an insuperable objection to hypodermic
injections; 2. Cases living at such a distance or too poor to make daily
visits to a physician; 3. In the after treatment of cases which have been
relieved by the treatment of emetine; 4. In the treatment of carriers; and
5. In the treatment of cases of Craigiasis, which indeed cannot be treated
so well with emetine alone as with emetine combined with some preparation
of ipecac which can be administered orally.’’

The endameba which is the specific cause of Pyorrhea Alveolaris
is almost invariably destroyed by Alcresta Ipecac. Bass and Johns found
that the germ would disappear from all lesions in from one to three days
in ninety per cent of the cases, and in six days from ninety-nine per cent of
the cases. They found it as efficient in most cases as emetine. The peculiar
combination involved in this substance prevents the alkaloids from being
dissolved in acid or neutral solutions. Thus it passes unchanged through
the stomach without inducing nausea in any form. The alkaloids are per-

mitted full activity in the intestinal tract. The local influence of this agent
upon the endameba in the mouth is very prompt and satisfactory.

In extreme inactive conditions of the stomach and bowels, with or without
pain—the inactivity shown by a broad, pallid tongue, covered very thickly with
a dirty white coat, which finally becomes sleek on the top, increasing from tip
to base in dirtiness, to a brown color—full emetic doses of the common
forms of ipecac persisted in for a short time will quickly correct almost the
entire train of symptoms.

Therapy—For its emetic influence ipecac is one of the most satisfactory
of the emetics. When there is undigested food in the stomach, causing irritation, when mild poisons are taken, when emesis is demanded
to relieve sick headache, this agent is used in preference to others. If
promptness of action be demanded the full dose should be given in a bowl of
warm water—not hot—or a single full dose of lobelia may be given with it.
- This produces immediate emesis without prostration. If powerful poisons
are taken, and active emesis is demanded, the sulphate of zinc or lobelia in persistent doses, or some other emetic more immediate in its influence, is usually
used, although the writer has always been able to adjust ipecac with such adjuvants as warm water, mustard, or tickling of the throat, to every case. In
cases where foreign bodies are lodged in the oesophagus, and in the threatened suffocation of mucous croup, or in membranous croup, ipecac is the
remedy, especially in childhood. No emetic more harsh should be used with
children. In the developing stage of malarial fevers it was once the practice to produce active diaphoresis by a hot pediluvium and hot drinks, the
patient being wrapped in warm blankets, and to produce profound emesis with
ipecac. Often the most desirable results were obtained, and in some cases
where an acute cold had been contracted or where there was a severe chill,
in strong, previously healthy patients, the disease, was suddenly terminated
by this course. The author has had this experience. In the bronchitis of
childhood occurring often suddenly, with a dry, hoarse, stridulous or
croupal cough, without secretion, ten drops of the syrup of ipecac given
every half hour, hour, or two hours until nausea in induced, will sometimes
abort the condition in a few hours, the influence of the agent dissipating
the conditions essential to the progress of the disease. This form of bronchitis
is common in furnace-heated houses, and in close, hot, unventilated apartments,
in the beginning of the winter when the furnace fire is first started, and in
the spring.

Ipecac in small doses given in conjunction or in alternation with aconite
or bryonia or belladonna, is of great service in pneumonia, especially that of
childhood. Five drops in a half glass of water, a teaspoonful every hour, may
be given with the best of results. In acute bronchitis it may be prescribed
in the same manner.

Ipecac is of value also in the after stages of pneumonia. In the stage
of active inflammation it is useful as stated, but is not given in the same form
as in the later stages. It is an excellent remedy to assist in clearing up
hepatization, and in restoring normal conditions in the lung cells. The
author, when the temperature has subsided, gives one-fourth to one-half a
grain of powdered ipecac to an adult, every two or three hours in a capsule,
with two grains of the bisulphate of quinine. The tonic influence of the
quinine assists the influence of the ipecac.

Ipecac is of value in coughs when there is a deficient secretion, whatever
the cause. Emetic doses are not desirable if the agent is to be continued for
a length of — 7

This agent is advised in irritation of the bowels resulting in acute inflammation. In small doses it is given with good results in cholera infantum and
in diarrheas, but is of no benefit beyond the acute stage.

While ipecac has been known as a cure for certain forms of dysentery
for more than a century, the use of its active principle emetine as a cure for
amebic dysentery is just now coming into prominence. Our writers have
always advised ipecac for this disease, but not all have given it in sufficiently
large doses. Administered now in the form of alcresta ipecac or emetine hypodermically, the cures are prompt and highly satisfactory. In fact, the remedy
is already being classed with quinine for malaria, and antitoxin for diphtheria,
as one of the great specifics.

If the dysenteric tenesmus is relieved with prompt doses of gelsemium—
and we have a no more efficient remedy in the materia medica for this condition than that agent—the beneficial effects of the ipecac upon the local inflammatory processes will be more plainly marked.

Recent observers in the general hospital in Calcutta, India, have found
that large doses of ipecac have most beneficial effects in amebic hepatitis and
hepatic abscess. If the diagnosis be made before the formation of pus, this
is prevented by the agent. It should be given when the patient suffers with
a general feeling of lassitude, foul tongue, pain in the right shoulder and in
the right hypochondrium. The liver is enlarged and tender on pressure. There
is marked leukocytosis but the polynuclear increase is not great. Ipecac is
given in these cases in single large doses, usually from twenty to thirty grains,
given at least two hours after eating and best taken at bedtime. Occasionally
this dose is given twice daily in capsules.

Frazier claims that ipecac in large doses is an excellent addition to the
treatment of typhoid fever. In five cases where he used it, the temperature dropped suddenly so that within four days it was normal. In the earlier
stages he gave thirty grains on the first day; twenty-five the next; twenty the
next and so on down until ten. He gave small doses of opium to keep the
patient from vomiting. The results were pronounced. This course is worth
trying.

The successful use of this common remedy, in the treatment of epilepsy
has been reported, since our first edition. Persistent cases have been treated,
with ten minim doses of a strong fluid extract, increased to forty minims. This
has been persisted in according to the susceptibility of the patient. The action
of emetine or alcresta ipecac should be at once determined for the above conditions.

In hemorrhages Ipecac has exercised a satisfactory influence. Its action upon the circulation is quite prompt. It is given by some physicians in
small doses for this purpose, and by others in full doses to prompt emesis. It
has controlled postpartum hemorrhage, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, epistaxis
and hemoptysis, and will exercise a beneficial influence in hematuria.

EXPECTORANTS AND SEDATIVES 247

Therapy—This agent is best known for its action upon the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. It increases expectoration and is actively
nauseating.

For this effect it is given in severe bronchial coughs without secretion,
in dry, harsh irritating coughs, the sputum scanty and tenacious. It has a
soothing influence over bronchial irritation.

Squill is an active diuretic. Given in non-inflammatory conditions
where there is lack of tone, reflection of the mucous membrane, with debility, it
stimulates the entire urinary structures. It has long been given in dropsy for
the removal of the fluid, its action’ being prompt and efficient, partly because it
stimulates the action of the heart, improves the circulation and strengthens the
pulse.

It may be given in conjunction with apocynun, digitalis or crategus, with
all of which it acts harmoniously.

GRINDELIA ROBUSTA.

Synonyms—Wild Sunflower, Gum plant.

PREPARATIONS—Fluid Extract of the leaves and flowering tops. Dose onehalf to one fluid dram. Solid Extract. Dose, 5 to 15 grains.

Specific Medicine Grindelia—Dose, from two to ten drops.

Physiological Action—The influence of the agent is exhibited on the
heart, at first by a quickened pulse, subsequently by retarding it. It elevates
the blood pressure at first, subsequently lowering it. In overdoses it is toxic,
the specific influence of the agent on the respiratory nerves being shown by
paralysis of the muscles of respiration.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent is specific to asthmatic breathing.
It must be given in full and frequent doses, and the effects, although not striking from a single dose, are soon evident and are more or less permanent. It
soon relieves the effort of breathing and produces expectoration, but on continued use the entire train of symptoms slowly abate, and if persisted in the
paroxysms do not soon recur.

Therapy—In spasmodic asthma, pure and simple, with complete relief
between attacks, it is not the remedy. It is an excellent antispasmodic expectorant in all chronic spasmodic bronchial coughs, and in chronic bronchitis,
Asthmatic bronchitis is often benefited, from the first dose, by its use. In
whooping cough it is of value in combination with other more specific agents.

It will relieve the irregular heart action often accompanying chronic
coughs, and improve the strength and general character of that organ.

Grindelia has relieved many cases of hay fever and has cured some few,
for the time being. In the chronic cough following pneumonia the agent has
been used with good results.

As an application to the skin when poisoned by rhus toxicodendron, this
agent is valuable. It acts promptly and satisfactorily.

It is curative also in the bites of insects, quickly antidoting the poisoning.

As applied to old indolent ulcers it has given unusual satisfaction in a
few cases, although not often used.

Co-operatives—It may be combined with good results with lobelia, stramonium, drosera, or ipecac, and in some cases for continued use, small doses
of the iodide of potassium will act nicely with it.

QUEBRACHO. ASPIDOSPERMA QUEBRAOHO.

Synonym—Quebracho Blanco.

ConstITUENTS—The bark of Quebracho contains at least six alkaloids.
Aspidospermine, which is thought to be one of these, is not a single alkaloid,
but represents the full activity of the drug; dose, 14 to 4 grain.

PREPARATIONS—Fluid Extract Quebracho, not miscible with water; dose,
fifteen minims to one fluid drachm. Solid Extract Quebracho; ohe part equals
ten of drug; dose, one to three grains.

Physiological Action—In investigating the physiological action of this
agent, Penzoldt determined that its influence was exerted upon the heart and
respiratory functions. He found in different forms of dyspnea—from emphysema severe bronchitis, phthisis, chronic pneumonic processes, with periodic
asthma and pleuritis, that after giving one to two teaspoonful doses of a solution sometimes two or three times a day, the frequency of breathing generally
diminished, the respirations were less deep, and that the cyanosis especially,
in phthisis and emphysema, was almost invariably diminished or removed. The
effects lasted for hours and were followed, without exception, by improvement
of the patient. It is now prescribed for the above conditions. In one case of
inherited pulmonary stenosis, and in another of thrombosis of the left main
branch of the pulmonary artery, the effect was remarkable, though but temporary.

Mariasi y Larrion, of Madrid, employed quebracho in a number of diseases
of the respiratory and circulatory organs. The following conclusions are a
short resume of his observations from a paper translated for the Therapeutic
Gazette in 1880:

“‘The principal action of this drug is to cause a diminution of the number
of pulse beats per minute, and lessen the frequency of the respiratory act.

‘‘Its principal and direct action is on the circulatory center, giving tone
and regularity to the contractions of the heart, with an intermediate effect on
the nervous system.’’

Specific Symptomatology—Quebracho acts specifically in restricted, difflcult breathing—dyspnea, as occurring in many forms of heart disease and
mildly in asthma of whatever character.

It is not employed with such good effects in nervous dyspnea.

Its action is rapid, and is manifested almost immediately after the administration of the medicament.

Its administration in the doses indicated is not dangerous, and its continuation will not have any undesirable influence on other organs.

Therapy—Hale calls it the digitalis of the lungs and lauds it for its influence on difficult breathing without much distinction as to the cause.

The agent has quite a positive influence in malarial fevers.

In thrombosis of the pulmonary artery, in some cases of apoplexy, and
in uremic dyspnea, it has been of great service. Those of our own physicians who have used it wherever there is difficulty in breathing are enthusiastic in praise of the relief it gives. It overcomes some severe cases
of cyanosis, and although its influence is not always permanent, it often prolongs life and the relief is most grateful to the patient.

It undoubtedly removes temporary obstruction to the oxidation of the
blood and by stimulating the respiratory centers it increases oxidation, and
facilitates the excretion of carbonic acid.

The agent has quite a positive influence in malarial fevers with or without lung complications, acting as a sedative, antiperiodic and febrifuge. It
is not widely used for this purpose and it does not influence other fevers.

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE RESPIRATORY TRACT 249

Agents Acting Upon the Mucous and Serous Structures of the Respiratory Tract.

STICTA. " DROSERA. POTASSIUM BICHROMATE.
ASCLEPIAS. EUPHRASIA.
STIOTA. STICTA PULMONARIA

Synonym—Lungwort.

ConstTITUENTS—Not analyzed.

__,PReParaTions—Specific Medicine Sticta; dose, from one-tenth to ten

Specific Symptomatology—This agent acts directly upon irritation in
the chest, especially when complicated with irritation of the nerve centers.

Pain beneath the scapule extending to the occiput, sharp pain with soreness above the scapule, or in the shoulders, especially indicate sticta.

As given by Felter and Lloyd in the American Dispensatory, the indications are as follows: Pain in the shoulders or in the back of the neck extending to the occiput, soreness or dull pain in the chest, or in the extrinsic respiratory muscles, which is increased by deep breathing. Irritation at the base of
the brain, or in those organs or parts supplied by the pneumogastric nerve.
Irritative cough; cough persistent and dry, of a rasping or wheezing character; short, sharp, hacking cough, with quick darting pains in the chest walls.
They also advise it in the treatment of rheumatism, which involves the muscles
and smaller joints. It may be given in hay fever, where the headache is
severe, and in catarrhal disorders, where there is frontal tension, with sneezing,
coryza and conjunctivitis.

It is given in the exhaustive cough of phthisis, bronchitis, and laryngitis.
It relieves the cough and irritation in these cases and controls hectic fever,
chills and night sweats.

Therapy—tin coughs of acute bronchitis, with the indications named, it
is useful; in cough, with wheezing and tightness—asthmatic cough, with the
characteristic quick, sharp pains, it is indicated. It also influences directly
the post-nasal mucosa.

It is valuable in some forms of vatarrh, especially if there is reflex irritation. It has been used in whooping-cough and in croupal coughs.

Sticta has been suggested in rheumatism where the muscles of the chest
are involved, where there is sharp, quick pain on respiration or where the muscles of the shoulder are sore and tender, where the muscles of the neck are
involved.

The remedy has been used in scarlet fever to good advantage, but we

have a specific directions for its administration in these cases beyond those
named.
It has a specific influence in the treatment of those forms of hay fever
and in those attacks of influenza characterized by the discharge of a hot,
irritating, watery mucous, which afterwards becomes thick, bloody, greenish
or yellow.

The catarrhal disorders to which this remedy is applicable are characterized by headache, with tearing pains through the side of the face and lower
jaw, with pressure in the forehead, at the root of the nose, coryza, conjunctivitis, soreness and dull pains in the chest.

ASCLEPIAS. ASCLEPIAS TUBEROSA.

Synonym—Pleurisy Root.

ConsTITUENTS—Glucoside, tannic and gallic acids, resin, fixed oil, volatile
oil, fat, gum, starch.

PrEPARATIONS—Extractum Asclepiadis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Asclepias. Dose, from one to five grains. Specific Asclepias. Dose, from one to
sixty minims.

Action—Diaphoretic, expectorant, cathartic, tonic.

Physiological Action—In regard to the influence of asclepias, Grover Coe,
M. D.,; writing in 1858, gives the following wide range of action. He says:
‘*No other remedy with which we are acquainted is so universally admissible
in the treatment of disease, either alone or in combination. In fact we think
of no pathological condition that would be aggravated by its employment. It
expels wind, relieves pain, relaxes spasm, induces and promotes perspiration,
equalizes the circulation, harmonizes the action of the nervous system, and
accomplishes its work without excitement; neither increasing the force or frequency of the pulse, nor raising the temperature of the body. It is of special
service in the treatment of affections involving the serous membranes, as
pleuritis, peritonitis, etc.’’ In this it resembles bryonia closely.

The most active apparent influence of this agent is upon the sudoriparous glands. It is distinctively an eliminative agent of general utility. It is
mild in its influence, but if given with confidence it will produce good
results.

Specific Symptomatology—lIts first direct effect is upon the serous membranes within the thorax. It is specific in pleuritic pains, both of the acute
and subacute variety, in doses of fifteen drops every two or three hours. For
these I have long prescribed this agent with positiveness, and have yet to be
disappointed. If effusion be present, its rapid removal is facilitated. The
pain and distress abate, the cough disappears, the respiration becomes free
and natural, the inspiration being especially pleasant; the heart takes on increased tone, and the entire contents of the thoracic cavity seemed benefited.
I have treated with this remedy the ‘‘stitch in the side,’? which had been
present for many months after pleurisy, and have removed it satisfactorily.

This agent will cure pains in the chest unaccompanied by prominent
symptoms, acute, sharp and cutting, recurrent or persistent in their character, if given in doses of half a dram every two or three hours and persisted
in for a few days.

Therapy—It is beneficial in acute pleuritis specifically, also in bronchitis,
pneumonitis and peritonitis. It has distinct expectorant properties. In
tight and painful coughs with difficult respiration, especially where there is a
general suspension of secretion, with dry skin and mucous membranes, and in
soreness of the chest from coughing, it is a most excellent remedy. In all
these conditions if there is the least elevation of temperature its influence will
be greatly enhanced if given in conjunction with aconite.

It was in great repute among the older Eclectic physicians in the treatment
of acute pleuritis, as suggested above. They also used it in acute inflammations of serous membranes, especially if there were acute, quick pains, and a
tendency to serous effusion. Its eliminative action upon the skin greatly enhances its influence in these cases.

If the powdered asclepias be combined with ipecac and camphor, a powder
is produced with diaphoretic properties of an Improved Dover’s Powder.

To obtain active diaphoresis, asclepias should be given in strong, hot
infusion. Its influence in acute rheumatism should not be overlooked. It

may be combined with such agents as macrotys and colchicum, and will
markedly intensify their action, especially if aconite be indicated.

DROSERA. DROSERA ROTUNDIFOLIA.

Synonyms—Sundew, Youthwort, Lustwort.

PREPARATIONS—Fluid Extract Sundew; not miscible with water; dose, five
to twenty minims.

Specific Medicine Drosera, two to five minims. An excellent and potent
preparation.

German Tincture Sundew; an imported preparation, from the green plant;
dose, fifteen to sixty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—The field of the influence of this remedy is
narrow. It is specific to dry, irritable, persistent cough; also cough of a
hoarse, resonant, explosive, or spasmodic character, without secretion.

Therapy—It is an antispasmodic, expectorant, and sedative as applied to
such coughs. It will also relieve coughs of sympathetic origin, and so-called
nervous coughs. It will cure the cough of measles more quickly than other
remedies, and it will cure the after-cough of whooping-cough. It will terminate a whooping-cough and leave the patient free from cough, when the active
stage of the disease has passed. If there is a deficiency of bronchial secretion
it will be found of service during the progress of whooping-cough, modifying the _paroxysms of the disease; they, occurring less frequently.

It is serviceable in all chronic coughs of a dry, irritating character, especially if the central nervous system be irritated. It is of service in chronic
bronchitis and in phthisis pulmonalis.

It has also relieved asthmatic coughs, with nervous irritability. It has
been used in a few cases as a sedative and tonic in irritable conditions of the
stomach, relieving flatulence and curing mild cases of gastric ulcer.

EUPHRASIA. EUPHRASIA OFFICINALIS.

Synonym—Eyebright.. _PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Euphrasia; dose from one to sixty

Specific Symptomatology—The sphere of action of this agent is upon
frritating and catarrhal disease; first, of the upper portion of the respiratory
tract, and afterward of the mucous structures of the throat, and bronchial
tubes. It is more immediately beneficial if the discharge is thin and watery—
fluent. ‘‘Snuffies’’ in infants demands this remedy.

It is specific to acute disorders of the nasal mucous membranes. It is
especially applicable in children’s cases, but is curative also in adults. Where
there is watery discharge from these membranes, where there is earache, or
headache, and especially if the distress be across the eyes, in acute catarrhal
affections, it has a direct influence upon the lachrymal apparatus.

Therapy—In cough and hoarseness, where there is a thin bronchial discharge, it is applicable especially to the catarrhal manifestations following
measles. It will prevent other sequle of measles, as catarrhal conjunctivitis, catarrhal deafness, and chronic nasal catarrh. It is indicated where
there is abundant secretion of thin acrid mucus, from the eyes and nose, with
pain and heat in the frontal sinus.

It is especially indicated in that form of recent colds that spend their force
on the mucous surfaces of the nose and throat with fullness of the frontal
sinus.

In acute coryza the agent exercises a specific action. It should be given
in ten drop doses of the tincture every hour or two. In ‘‘snuffles,’’ so called
in very young infants, five or ten drops of the tincture may be dropped into
a half of a glass of water, and a teaspoonful given every ten, fifteen or thirty
minutes. Relief is often immediate. In the coryza of measles it is of much
benefit, and the bronchial and pulmonary irritation caused by this disease is
ameliorated also by its use.

A reliable indication is a red and watery condition of the eyes—irritation of the lachrymal structures. Any unpleasant after influence of measles
upon the eyes is relieved by the use of Euphrasia. Its internal use will benefit many cases of conjunctivitis, especially those of recent origin in children.
the lachrymal structures. Any unpleasant after influence of measles upon
the eyes is relieved by the use of Euphrasia. Its internal use will benefit many
eases of conjunctivitis, especially those cases of recent origin in children.

A writer reports a chronic case of catarrh, in which the patient for
many months had seemed to be persistently renewing an acute cold in the head.
There was persistent sneezing, a constant inclination to blow the nose, and a
profuse watery secretion which, when lying down, continually ran from the
posterior nares. Five drops of specific euphrasia every two hours, cured this
patient within a couple of weeks. In children the smaller dose is preferable,
and a dose of ten drops will cure most of the acute cases. But some of the
chronic cases will not be benefited until they are given large, full doses. It is
claimed also that it has cured chronic catarrh of the intestinal tract.

It is excellent also as a collyrium in blepharitis, and conjunctivitis,
twenty drops in four ounces of water applied freely. It is given internally
at the same time. It is a tonic, improves the appetite, and conduces to a general sense of well being.

It is asserted that epilepsy has been successfully cured by giving four
ea of an infusion of this remedy, upon an empty stomach, every night at

POTASSIUM BICHROMATE.

Formula—K,Cr,0.

Synonym—Bichromate of Potassium.

Therapy—Triturated with sugar of milk this agent is of much service
in some cases of bronchitis. One one-hundredth of a grain of the salt so triturated will relieve dry, irritable bronchial coughs and produce amelioration of
symptoms in some stubborn cases.

It is useful in hoarseness from a cold, with the accompanying dry, hard
irritating cough. Harsh, rasping cough in the upper air tubes is influenced
by its persistent use.

This is the remedy with which to influence congestion of the larynx.

It will cure hoarseness after a cold. It should be given where there is
dry catarrh, with dry exudation from the nose, or greenish discharge, the
disease advancing until there is deep ulceration. Any discharge from mucous
membranes that is tough and stringy that can be drawn out in long strings,
-- will be cured by very small doses of this salt.

Bichromate of Potassium is beneficial in cases of aphonia from congestion. One grain in four ounces of water, a teaspoonful every two, three or
four hours, is about the proper dosage. It is also given where there is chronic,
spasmodic, bronchial cough, accompanied with hoarseness or with a sense of
dryness in the naso-pharynx. Dr. Cole uses it in the dyspepsia of beer
drinkers with good results, but he thinks that the 2x trituration in & one,

grain tablet is the best form to give it. One doctor gives it in diphtheria
about one-sixtieth of a grain at a dose. He finds that it clears off the exudate
and promotes a cure in some cases especially if used in combination with echinacea or phytolacca.

CHAPTER III.

Agents Acting Upon the Mucous and Serous Structures of the Respiratory Tract.

TURPENTINE. BENZOIN. ACETIC ACID.
TEREBENE. AMMONIUM CHLORIDE.
TURPENTINE. OLEUM TEREBINTHINZ.

Synonyms—Long-leaved Georgia, Swamp, or Pitch Pine.

Occurrence—Turpentine is obtained from the Pinus Plaustris and from
other species of the pine in the form of an oleoresin.

The oleoresin is distilled, and the product is the Oil of Turpentine or
the Spirits of Turpentine. The residue is Resin (colophony).. Description—The oil is a thin, neutral, colorless liquid, with a specific
gravity of 0.87, soluble in three volumes of alcohol. It boils at about 330
degrees Fahrenheit.

PrEPaRATIONS—The oil distilled with six volumes of lime water, produces
the Rectified oil of Turpentine (Oleum Terebinthine Rectificatum). This is
the form which should always be used in medicine. Dose, from one to ten
minims. It should be given in an emulsion for gastric and intestinal disorders.
For respiratory disorders, drop from two to five drops on a square of loaf
sugar to be dissolved slowly on the tongue, and swallowed with the saliva.

Terpene hydrate is formed by the action of nitric acid upon the rectified oil of turpentine, and alcohol. The product is distilled; it is crystalline,
colorless, nearly odorless; slightly soluble in water, soluble in alcohol. Dose,
from one to three gr

Terebene is obtained by the action of sulphuric acid on the rectified oil.
The product is distilled. A colorless, thin, aromatic liquid is the result. It
is soluble in alcohol, only slightly so in water. Dose, from three to fifteen

Physiological Action—The oil of turpentine is an irritant when applied
to the skin or mucous membranes in any considerable quantity. It causes burning, a vesicular eruption, and deep, stubborn ulcerations. In the stomach it
produces warmth, increased from an overdose to a burning pain, nausea, vomiting, purging, eructations of the oil, great gastro-intestinal irritation, amounting to gastro-enteritis. In toxic doses it causes renal hyperemia, great irritation of the urinary tract, violent hematuria and strangury, with suppression of
urine and albuminuria.

It stimulates the heart, increases the arterial tension for a time, increases
the temperature and exalts the mental faculties. Ultimately there is a reduction of physical strength, muscular insecurity, tremblings, inco-ordination,
great nervous irritation, wandering of the mind, incoherence, insensibility and
coma, breathing stertorous and labored, from paralysis of respiration; face cyanosed or flushed, pupils dilated. All exudations contain its odor.

While violent symptoms have often been produced by full medicinal doses
of turpentine, fatal results have seldom occurred. Five ounces have been taken
by adults with recovery. Children have died from overdoses in a few instances. The agent is eliminated through the kidneys and mucous membrane,

254 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

and this fact explains its immediate influence upon these organs and structures..

Specific Symptomatology—In two marked conditions apparently diametrically opposite in their character, this agent is specific.

First. In excessive secretion of mucus—catarrhal discharges from whatever cause, especially if there be relaxed, enfeebled, atoniec mucous membranes. It may be given with confidence.

Second; in gastric or intestinal inflammation, or in persistent fevers, with
dry, red, glazed tongue, dry mucous membranes—tympanites, with suppression of the secretions of all gastric and of intestinal glands.

It is also indicated by a steady distress or dull grinding pain in the abdomen, a sensation of hardness across the abdomen, with tendency to constipation, with general inactivity of the entire glandular structure of the gastrointestinal tract.

It increases the tone and capillary circulation of all the mucous structures, and in the abdomen of the muscular structures of the intestines also.
Its antiseptic powers are great, destroying parasites and germs of disease,
and inhibiting putrefaction and fermentation.

In intestinal disorders of childhood it prevents the formation of lactic
and butyric acids, and the irritation caused by their presence.

Therapy—The specific indications suggest the use of turpentine in acute
and chronic bronchitis when there is an excessive discharge of mucus. Its
influence may be observed from the first.

-It controls the cough, allays the excessive bronchial secretion, soothes the
irritation throughout the chest, relieves the diffused soreness and promotes the
cure. In pharyngitis and laryngitis it is of value also.

In acute inflammations within the chest its external application is of much
value, especially in pneumonitis or capillary bronchitis with diffused soreness. Soreness and tenderness in acute fevers and inflammations are relieved by the external use of turpentine, while quick, sharp, acute pain is
best combated by the external use of mustard and anodyne counter-irritants.

In croup its influence is direct. In both the mucous and membranous
forms it has accomplished excellent results. It is given internally, applied externally, and its vapors are inhaled in these cases for a short time, careful watch
being kept for evidences of its irritating influence upon the kidneys. In some
extreme cases where it has not been previously used, a single large dose of ten
or fifteen drops to a child of five years or above, will apparently exercise
a prompt influence.

In diphtheria with occlusion of the larynx, throat or nasal passages, from
the membrane, it should be dropped on the surface of hot water in a closemouthed vessel, and the vapor inhaled for a few minutes every two or three
hours. It may be used in this manner with excellent results with an equal
amount of the oil of eucalyptus. It may be also used in an atomizer for this
purpose. In all throat difficulties its external application is beneficial.

It is a remedy for acute and chronic nasal catarrh and if given persistently it will prove most serviceable, even in stubborn, chronic cases, In
gastric or intestinal catarrh it is a remedy of much value given in proper
doses in palatable emulsion. Pain due to this condition is quickly relieved
by turpentine, and atonic, relaxed and enfeebled mucous or muscular structures quickly restored, and normal function attained.

Turpentine is a most excellent remedy in the treatment of typhoid typhus
and low forms of fever, and in typhoid complications of acute inflammations.
In these conditions, when the tongue is dry, glazed and dark red, the temperature persistently high, the pulse small, wiry, rapid and feeble, with distention
of the abdomen from tympanites, the urine scanty and dark, the intestinal

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE RESPIRATORY TRACT 255

glands ulcerated and intestinal hemorrhage present, turpentine is certainly a
most efficient remedy. Its antiseptic influence is exercised in conjunction
with its restorative power over the mucous and intestinal glands. It is given
in doses of from two to five drops every two or three hours.

In peritonitis or appendicitis with any of the above phenomena with
tympanites the agent is prescribed with only good results.

In all conditions within the abdomen where its internal use is demanded,
especially if there is distention of the abdominal parieties from the accumulation of gases, the external use of turpentine is important. A stupe may be
prepared by wringing a piece of flannel out of hot water and sprinkling a
few drops of turpentine over its surface as it is applied. This should be kept
hot by being properly covered. A popular domestic method is to melt a
quantity of lard and add to it an equal quantity of turpentine and apply this
freely to the surface. Olive oil is a good menstruum, but an increased proportion of this oil is required because of less density than the lard.

In all cases pain must not be caused by the turpentine applications. Its
influence also upon the kidneys must be watched, and if difficult, painful or
burning urination, or scanty urination occurs, or the least blood appears in
the urine, it must be stopped at once, at least for a time. In large doses it
produces nephritis, strangury and priapism. Inhaled constantly it will produce these symptoms in those otherwise healthy.

Turpentine has been used in passive hemorrhages. It prevents the
hemorrhage of typhoid and controls hemorrhage in gastric ulceration. It
controls hematuria given in small doses, in some cases, and also the hemorrhage of scurvy and purpura hemorrhagica. In extreme persistent postpartum hemorrhage, after complete evacuation of the womb, it has been
painted over the inner lining of the womb with immediate control of the
hemorrhage. The conditions demanding its use in passive hemorrhage are
great relaxation of tissue, lack of tone, dilated and atonic blood vessels, with
constitutional depression—conditions permitting a passive transudation of
blood.

In catarrh of the bladder it is an excellent remedy. It may be given in
conjunction with other measures or suggested remedies. In all these cases
the indications for other remedies should be promptly met to facilitate the
action of this remedy.

Turpentine internally is a serviceable remedy for leucorrhea, either of
a specific or non-specific character. It has long been used in the treatment
of gonorrhea, but is not the best of our remedies. In pyelitis with excessive
mucous discharges, in gleet, in subacute gonorrhea, it will allay the discharge occasionally when other agents have been inefficient.

Incontinence of urine from relaxation and feebleness of structure has
been benefited by turpentine.

In the treatment of dysentery when the violent phenomena have been
controlled, and in some exhausting diarrheas, turpentine will be found of
much service. It is best given in small doses in such cases. It has been used
in yellow fever and in cholera also.

Turpentine is applied to swellings from chronic rheumatism of the
joints, to plethoric swellings, and slow forming abscesses.

It is of much value in chilblains, and, although painful, has been painted
aed small burned areas. It has been used in gangrene also with good results.

Erysipelas has been treated with turpentine, but we cannot commend
its influence.

Turpentine is an efficient anthelmintic for the removal of tenia. It is
given in a single full dose of from thirty to sixty minims upon rising in the

teaspoonful of hot milk. The patient should fast, until the oil operates, All
nervous phenomena dependent upon the irritation caused by the presence
of the worms will abate with the destruction of the worms. This is not due
to any nerve sedative influence of the turpentine, however.

Whitford treated thirty cases of trichina spiralis at one time with the
persistent use of turpentine. Five drops every three hours was sufficient.
The diagnosis in the larger number of the cases was confirmed by the microscope. As every case recovered which was so treated, his confidence was
naturally confirmed in this use of turpentine. At another time two parties
were known to have eaten of a certain lot of pork which on examination was
found teeming with trichina. Both were affected in the same manner and
death seemed imminent. One was treated with turpentine and recovered;
the other died. In nearly all of the cases, the beneficial results were plainly
traceable to this remedy.

BENZOIN

The Tincture of Benzoin has been a popular remedy in the past. It is
given in doses of from one-half to one dram. The compound tincture, composed of benzoin, storax, balsam of tolu, and purified aloes with alcohol is
advised for its influence in laryngeal and bronchial difficulties. The dose is
from one-half to two fluid drams of the official U. S. P. preparation.

The Compound Tincture is vaporized in hot water, and the vapor is inhaled in chronic and acute laryngitis. It is useful in many forms of bronchial irritation without secretion. Its antiseptic properties are not great,
but are apparent where there is a scanty, fetid expectoration.

AMMONIUM CHLORIDE.

Formula—NH,Cl.:

Synonyms—Ammonium Muriate, Chloride or Muriate of Ammonium.

Dose, from three to ten grains.

The taste should be obscured in an aromatic syrup.

Physiological Action—In its influence it exhibits the peculiarities of
ammonia, It is not widely different in its action from the carbonate, but
does not act powerfully upon the heart and is less transient in its effects.

During the last five years much has been learned concerning the specific
action of this remedy upon mucous surfaces. The author has observed that
while it influences the mucous membranes of the bronchial tubes, in a satisfactory manner, curing alone many cases of dry, harsh, irritable cough, and
relieving many cases of chronic cough, it is equally beneficial in its influence upon the mucous membranes of the stomach and gastro-intestinal tract.
It can also be used in purulent inflammation of the lining of the pelvis of
the kidney and bladder.

Administration—It is not necessary that large doses be given, as it
often produces excellent results in doses of less than a grain. One-half grain
doses will materially benefit bronchial coughs which have been persistent
and which are dry in character and recur with every change of the weather.
Many stubborn cases are reported as cured by small doses of this remedy.

Specific Symptomatology—The following indications are suggestive in
the administration of this chloride: Deficient capillary circulation, evidenced by dusky redness of the skin, the redness disappearing on pressure

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE RESPIRATORY TRACT 257

and returning slowly; ecchymosis of the surface of the body, especially of
the eyelids. A hot solution of the muriate of ammonia will quickly overcome
the discoloration of a violent contusion. Cough of a rasping, irritating,
tight and harsh character, with deficient or scanty secretion, is allayed by
it; also cough depending upon hepatic, gastric or intestinal irritation.

A German writer advises ammonium chloride for the same conditions of
the glandular structures of the body for which we advise phytolacca, but
believes in giving it in small doses. It certainly exercises an alternative influence, and it would be well to give these two agents together and observe
their action. One grain or even less of this agent at a dose will be sufficient.

Therapy—Its common use is in the treatment of bronchitis. In the
conditions where a stimulant expectorant is needed, as mentioned of the ammonium carbonate, its administration being more easily rendered pleasant,
it is more commonly used than the carbonate. It is a common ingredient of
many extemporized cough syrups. It is especially useful in catarrh of the
bronchi with relaxed and debilitated mucous membranes.

Catarrhs of all kinds are promptly influenced by its use, whether they
be nasal, gastric, intestinal, or gastro-intestinal, or catarrh of the bladder,
or leucorrhea, wherever there is an abundant thick secretion from the mucous membrane.

In catarrh of the stomach, with excessive acid secretion and constant
pain during digestion, ten grains of this salt before meals is often productive
of complete relief and subsequent cure. It should also be used in intesti
catarrh. It will be found of great service in colitis or ilecolitis and will relieve the irritation and pain present. In chronic diarrhea due to chronic
catarrhal irritation of these intestinal mucous membranes we have seen some
striking results. One case suffered from intense, acute intestinal pain and
chronic diarrhea, with a persistent temperature of from one hundred to one
hundred and one and a half degrees. The condition had been present two
years and a half, and a tubercular condition was diagnosed. The only
marked effects, from any remedy in this case, were observed from the action
of this chloride. It relieved the irritation and pain, controlled the diarrhea,
and there was slow abatement of the temperature. The patient attributed
all the beneficial results to this remedy, although there were other indicated
remedies given, which assisted in the total result.

Another case of intestinal indigestion, with frequent attacks of diarrhea,
accompanied with sharp, colicky pains, was cured with this remedy.

Whitford for many years has advised this agent as a specific in neuralgias. It is indicated in those of a rheumatic character, and those of a distinctly malarial type, with a tendency to periodicity, especially if occurring
in the face or head. In those cases where belladonna is not contraindicated,
he gives the two agents in conjunction in full doses. It is a serviceable remedy and his experience is confirmed by that of such men as Watson, Anstie
and Ringer. To give relief it must be given in doses of from ten to thirty
grains. Small doses are of but little benefit.

This agent is recommended highly in chronic inflammation of the liver
with torpor and engorgement. In catarrhal jaundice it stimulates the liver,
working actively in harmony with many of our organic remedies. In other
glandular affections it is of much value, especially where there is chronic
enlargement. This applies to mastitis, ovaritis and prostatitis. A solution
of the salt applied to enlarged glands is very efficacious, promoting removal
of the enlargement. It is also applicable to contusions and indolent tumors
and is applied to senile gangrene.

This agent should be used in the treatment of chronic prostatitis. It
may be given for a short time in large doses, and then continued in small

doses, the large dose to be repeated as the occasion demands. Many physicians claim that it is a positive cure in the treatment of prostatic enlargement. It soothes vesical irritation, relieves tenesmus, overcomes the mucopurulent discharge, and adds tone and vitality to the parts.

The drug is a stimulant to the capillary circulation and will be found
of benefit in exanthematous fevers, favoring the eruptive process, especially
if there has been a recession. Externally, the solutions of chloride of ammonium are applied to chilblains, parts threatened with gangrene, indolent
tumors and plethoric abscesses. It is also advantageous in erysipelas, and in
some forms of articular rheumatism. Mild solutions in the latter case will
effect satisfactory results. Applied in hot solution over an inflamed gland,
with soreness present, it has a beneficial influence, much as the chloride of
sodium would have under similar circumstances.

ACIDUM ACETICUM.

Formula—C,H,0,.

Synonyme—<Acetic Acid, Pyroligneous Acid, Acetyl Hydrate or the Hydrogen Acetate.

The pure, free, absolute acid is known as the Glacial Acetic Acid. It
contains ninety-nine per cent of the acid.

Vinegar is a liquid made from the juice of apples, acidulated with
Acetic Acid, which is produced therein by the ferment mycoderma aceti in
the natural process of acetous fermentation. Alcoholic fermentation first
takes place in the fermenting substance, and this is followed by the acetous
fermentation, produced artificially by the introduction of the characteristic
ferment, or mother of vinegar.

Therapy—tIn spasmodic croup a few drops quickly volatilized on a hot
surface, or on the surface of boiling water, will often give quick relief in
breathing. Its vapor is often diffused in the room from hot water in cases
of dry bronchial cough, in bronchitis, with excellent results. It is useful also
in diphtheria and membranous croup, both internally and externally. It is
of service in syrups forming an acetous syrup of many well known expectorants, such as sanguinaria, ipecac, lobelia and squills. The influence of the
other constituents is often enhanced by this combination.

Dr. Vassar advocates the use of acetic acid in nose bleed. He makes
a fifty per cent solution of vinegar and water, saturates cotton and passes
it back along the floor of the bleeding nostril. In extreme cases he uses full
strength vinegar. Sometimes he tampons posterially also.

Glacial acetic acid mixed with one part of chloroform and applied
lightly once a day to the bare spot will cure some cases of alopecia.

There is good authority for the use of acetic acid dilute, or strong vinegar in twenty-five per cent solution as an external application in many forms
of infectious disease. One so-called crank claimed to cure all chronic disease
with the use of vinegar baths. A case resembling general bubo, apparently
malignant infection of the glands, was rapidly relieved by the action of this
remedy externally.

There is a tradition that some nurses in the London Bubonic Plague of
the fourteenth century saved their lives and those of some patients by vinegar baths.

This agent is specific in carbolic acid poisoning. If Acetic Acid or plain
vinegar is at once diluted to a safe strength—one that can be swallowed
without strangulation, and given to the patient immediately after taking a

dose of carbolic acid, its influences are neutralized immediately, and no appearance of the destructive poisonous effects of the latter acid are apparent.
Henning took a teaspoonful of 95 per cent carbolie acid into his mouth for
a minute or more, then ejecting it, he held dilute acetic acid in the
mouth for a short time, when all evidences of the carbolic acid disappeared,
and no unpleasant symptoms whatever were experienced. Many cases are
reported of its prompt action in carbolic acid poisoning.

If acetic acid be poured on to a compress and inhaled by a patient after
the patient has taken chloroform, Lewis says it will relieve nausea and
vomiting from the chloroform, or prevent it, most effectually.

Many alcoholic habitues are in the habit of drinking vinegar diluted
with water to cut short a debauch, claiming that it produces steadiness of
action and overcomes the intoxicating effects of alcohol.

This acid is used as a reagent in the laboratory. It is used also in the
preservation of food stuffs, as it is actively antiseptic. Its vapor has been
used as a stimulant, inhaled in asphyxia, and syncope.

It has been used in the treatment of venereal sores and other specific
ulcers and in cancers, and it has been applied to gangrenous degeneration.


Agents Acting as Respiratory Sedatives and Mild Tonics.

PRUNUS. HELLIANTHUS. YERBA SANTA.
TOLU. ALLIUM. LIQUORICE.
PRUNUS. PRUNUS SEROTINA.

Synonym—Wild Cherry.

This is often called, though improperly, Prunus Virginiana, which belongs
to the Choke Cherry family.

Constirvents—Hydrocyanic acid, amygdalin, volatile oil, emulsion, tannin, gallic acid, resin, starch, a bitter principle.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Pruni Virginiane, Fluid Extract of Wild
Cherry. Dose, from a half to one dram. Specific Medicine Prunus. Dose, from
one to ten minims.

Therapy—The tonic influence of this agent is more markedly apparent
when it is administered in disease of the respiratory apparatus of a subacute or
chronic character. It is not given during the active period of acute cases, but
is of value during the period of convalescence.

It is a common remedy in the treatment of chronic coughs, especially those
accompanied with excessive expectoration. It is valuable in whooping-cough.
The syrup is used as a menstruum for the administration of other remedies
in this disease. It is excellent also in reflex cough—the cough of nervous patients without apparent cause. The syrup may be used persistently in phthisis,
for the administration of many other agents which seem to be indicated during
the course of the disease. Wild cherry is popular in the treatment of mild cases
of palpitation, especially those of a functional character, or from reflex causes.
Palpitation from disturbed conditions of the stomach is directly relieved by
it. It is said to have a direct tonic influence upon the heart when the muscular
structure of that organ is greatly weakened, where there is dilatation or
valvular insufficiency, especially if induced by prolonged gastric or pulmonary disease.

260 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

As a remedy for dyspepsia it has many advocates. It is a tonic to the
stomach improving digestion by stimulating the action of the gastric glands.
It soothes irritability of the stomach from whatever cause. Although the
properties of a nerve sedative are not ascribed to this agent, general nervous
irritation is soothed by its administration, nervous irritability of the stomach
and of the respiratory organs is allayed, and a tonic influence is imparted to
the central nervous system.

TOLU. BALSAM TOLU.

PrEPaRATIONS—Syrupus Tolutani, Syrup of Tolu; dose, from two to six
drams. Tincture Tolutani, Tincture of Tolu; dose, from one-half dram to two
drams.

Physiological Action—The remedy is disinfectant—antiseptic, and when
applied to the skin and to raw surfaces it is stimulant. It promotes healing of
wounds and restores impaired and abnormal conditions of the skin. It is direct
in its action upon mucous membranes, exercising a tonic and healing influence
and restoring deficient secretion. It is eliminated freely through these membranes and through the kidneys, hence its beneficial action upon these structures.

Therapy—The agent is used in all forms of bronchial irritation. Its
influence is not so readily observed in the acute forms as in the subacute and
chronic forms. It is not sufficiently active to be depended upon to the exclusion
of other more direct remedies, but it is serviceable in facilitating the action of
these remedies and in modifying the action of stimulating or irritating expectorants.

In the treatment of the various forms of cough, induced by disease of the
bronchi, the direct remedies may be often administered to excellent advantage
in the syrup of tolu. Short, sharp, hacking, dry coughs are directly benefited by
its use. On the other hand coughs accompanied with an extreme outpour of
thick mucus, with an atonic, relaxed condition of the mucous membranes, are
relieved by this agent.

It is serviceable in pharyngitis and in laryngitis. In whooping-cough it
is an excellent menstruum for the administration of the direct remedies.

In diseases of the gastro-intestinal tract, or of the kidneys where turpentine is indicated, that agent may be administered to an excellent advantage in
the syrup of tolu.
ALLIUM. ALLIUM SATIVUM.

Synonyms—Garlic, Onion.

ConsTITUENTS—It contains an essential volatile oil, mucilage, sugar and
albumen.

Administration—The fresh juice is used in medicine, the crushed bulbs
are used externally, and a tincture is prepared, of which from five to thirty
drops is the dose.

Physiological Action—There is positive proef of the antiseptic properties of this agent.

One writer claims that diphtheria does not occur in families that are free
partakers of the onion in any way. With many it produces flatulency. If used
moderately for a while the quantity can be increased without unpleasantness.
The odor is no more unpleasant than that of carbolic acid, creolin, asafetida
and some others..

Covert gave the following facts concerning the common onion: ‘‘The volatile oil is the essential part of the onion, and has not only gastronomic but
therapeutic merit. The onion is expectorant, stimulant, diuretic, rubefacient
and discutient, and as & domestic remedy is well remembered by the oldest inhabitants in the form of onion syrup, onion draughts, onion poultices and the
like. As a domestic remedy always at hand and of varied virtues it stands unrivaled.

The onion poultice stands in high favor with me for all swellings, such
as that of the throat in scarlet fever and diphtheria. It was long declared of
much importance in the treatment of croup and as an application to the
chest in all inflammations of the lungs and bronchi.

‘An onion may be roasted and the cut surface applied hot to glandular inflammations and suppurating tumors.’’

Bloyer advises the tincture of the Red Onion in gravel. The specific
indications are extreme urinary irritation, with a constant desire to urinate
and the passage of calcareous concretions. Hemorrhage and pus and mucus
are often present from inflammation of the bladder. The cystoscope shows
the bladder walls greatly thickened, nodulated and imbedded with concretions of various sizes. This persistent and almost incurable condition has
been quickly cured by a tincture of the red onion and the tincture of cocklebur in equal parts, from fifteen to twenty drops given every three hours.
The cure of this. condition alone by the agent will give it a place in therapeutics.

ERIODICTYON. ERIODICTYON GLUTINOSUM.

Synonym—Yerba Santa.

ConstiTvENTs—Volatile oil, fixed oil, ericolin, eriodictyonic acid, resin,

tannin.

>
gum, tannin. sone—Extractum Eriodictyi Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Eriodictyon; dose, from a half to one dram. Specific Yerba Santa; dose, from five
to twenty minims.

Therapy—Yerba Santa has a soothing influence upon irritating, dry,
hacking, persistent coug’ ‘h.

It is of value in chronic bronchitis, chronic pneumonitis and in phthisis

onalis, in allaying the cough which seems to increase the patient’s feebleness and advance the development of the disease. It is an excellent remedy combined with grindelia robusta. It acts well in all forms of cough
where there is dryness of the mucous membranes, in conjunction with other
directly indicated remedies. It is prepared in the form of a syrup, and like
prunus virginiana, can be made a basis or vehicle for other agents. The
syrup conceals the bitter taste of quinine admirably.

GLYCYRRHIZA. GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA.

Synonym—Liquorice.

ConstiTveNTs—Glycyrrhizin, glycyramarin, asparagin, resin, sugar, starch.

PreparaTions—Extractum Glycyrrhize, Extract of Glycyrrhiza, (Extract
of Liquorice). Dose, ad libitum. Extractum Glycyrrhize Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Glycyrrhiza. Dose, ad libitum; of the powdered root from 15 to 60

Therapy—The agreeable taste of liquorice in any form covers to a practical extent the taste of very many disagreeable remedies. Acrid and bitter

tastes are well disguised by it. A syrup made by adding two parts of the fluid
extract to fourteen parts of simple syrup will disguise the bitter or otherwise
unpleasant taste of a large proportion of the fluid extracts. The taste of quinine
can be concealed by it to a considerable extent.

Its demulcent properties render it useful in inflammation, or irritation of
the mucous membranes of the lungs and bronchi. In combination with ipecac,
lobelia, squill, sanguinaria, or ammonium chloride, an excellent expectorant
mixture or cough syrup may be extemporized, as this agent modifies any acrid
or irritating influence the other agents may exhibit.

The virtue of the Compound Liquorice Powder of the dispensatory does
not depend upon the properties of the liquorice, only as it imparts to the
whole a pleasant taste.


Respiratory Sedatives and Tonics.

CASTANEA. CASTEANEA VESCA.
Synonym— Chestnut.
erapy—tThis agent is lauded as a specific for whooping-cough. The

evidence adduced would lead to the conclusion that certain conditions not yet
determined, must be present if it exercises curative powers. In certain experiments it has apparently ameliorated the symptoms promptly. In some cases
there was 8 prompt arrest of the disease. In other cases no results have been
apparent. It should receive thorough investigation to determine the specific
conditions in which it will exercise a curative influence.

It should be given in full doses every two or three hours. If it proves
curative in whooping-cough it should be found of service in other bronchial
coughs with free secretion.

LIPPIA. LIPPIA MEXICANA.

Synonym—Lippia Dulcis.

PreparaTions—Concentrated tincture, miscible with water without material precipitation. Four parts of the tincture equal one of the drug; dose,
one-half to one dram. Fluid Extract Lippia; dose, ten to twenty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—Persistent, dry, hard, ringing or resonant
bronchial cough, hoarse, barking or metallic cough. The use of this agent
is limited to the air passages.

Therapy—It is useful in asthma and chronic bronchitis. It is peculiarly
sedative to the entire mucous surfaces of the post-nasal region and bronchial
tubes. It is soothing, expectorant, and relieves irritability of these surfaces.
It quiets hacking cough and chronic bronchial cough of any character. The
experience of the writer has proven it specific in the peculiar, deep, resonant,
barking, winter cough, without secretion, common to many ladies in the north.
ern States, usually absent in the summer, very persistent, stubborn and difficult
to cure. This cough, lippia has cured for the writer in several cases. In every
case the cough failed to recur in the following winter, as it had recurred before
in several preceding winters.

RESPIRATORY SEDATIVES AND TONICS 263
PENTHORUM. PENTHORUM SEDOIDES.

Synonym—Virginia Stonecrop.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Penthorum. Dose, from one to twenty
minims. -

Specific Symptomatology—It is suggested in cases of chronic disease of
the fauces, larynx, or pharynx, where the mucous membranes are relaxed
and of purple color, irritable, sore and dry. This condition sometimes, resists all ordinary throat remedies. Five drops of specific penthorum every
two hours with a gargle of capsicum, quite strong, used three times daily,
will quickly relieve the troublesome condition. The gargle alone is of benefit.

Therapy—It influences the functional activity of the stomach through
the direct action on the glandular structure of the mucous membranes. It will
impart tone to the stomach and increase the appetite and power of the digestion. It regulates the function also of the entire intestinal tract in a mild, but
sometimes very desirable manner.

The remedy has been employed in the treatment of cholera infantum,
where a mild tonic astringent was needed, and in many forms of diarrhea.
In piles it may be given in conjunction with collinsonia or hamamelis. It
has been lauded in the treatment of intestinal dyspepsia, and other forms of
atonic indigestion, especially where nervous exhaustion is present. Scudder
remarked that mucous membranes in any locality, which had suffered from
acute inflammation, were markedly susceptible to the action of this remedy
in its direct restorative influence. It will remove irritation, restore the
functional activities of the glands, and conduce to the return of the normal
condition. He gave it also for chronic catarrh, pharyngitis, bronchitis,
vaginitis and other catarrhal disorders. The fluid extract of penthorum may
be given in doses of from one-fourth to one dram, every three hours.

Additional specific symptoms, are catarrhal inflammation, with profuse
secretion, catarrhal gastritis, colitis, or iliocolitis, with mucous discharges and
a spongy condition of the gums.

TRILLIUM. TRILLIUM PENDULUM.

Synonym—Bethroot.

Const1Tvents—An acrid principle, a resin, tannic acid.

Therapy—tTrillium influences mildly the nerve supply of the organs of
the thorax. It assists heart remedies in relieving ample functional irritation.
It cures catarrhal bronchitis when there is very profuse expectoration. It
soothes the cough of incipient phthisis, especially where there is a tendency
to hemorrhage, over which it has a marked controlling influence. It restrains
excessive action of the kindneys. At one time it had an excellent reputation in the control of diabetes insipidus.

It controls uterine hemorrhage of a passive character to an excellent
advantage, especially menorrhagia and metrorrhagia, Excessive vaginal
catarrh is restrained by it.

Agents Acting upon the Stomach.


Agents which Increase the Normal Functional Activity of the Stomach—Stomachics.

COLLINSONIA. GLYCERINE. Quassia.

CALUMBA. EUPATORIUM. SUMACH.

GENTIAN LYCOPODIUM. CORNUS.
' CROCUS.

Note—Among the agents of the second and third divisions of the first group
of remedies in this book are several such as nux vomica, strychnine, capsicum,
xanthoxylum, hydrastis, quinine, and avena, which serve a first purpose as
stomach tonics although otherwise classed. Three or four of the above named
remedies have been popular as such in the entire profession for many years.
Other than these, the remedies here included in this and the following chapter
although presented at some length, are mild in their action and possess properties, which are without doubt included in the influence of the remedies first
above referred to, which possess an essentially wider and more positive influence.

There is great similarity in the action of such remedies as cornus florida,
ptelia, liatris, frasera, asarum and others of this character, which is mild
throughout the entire field of their operation. They have no pronounced

Those in this first chapter at least have specific individual peculiarities that
make them distinctive.

In the administration of the pure stomach tonics, if the indications for
an acid are present, as shown by deep-red membranes, and a dark, narrow
thin tongue, the agents of this group are best given in conjunction with
hydrochloric or nitro-hydrochloric acid, or if the indications are those described in the specific symptomatology of this agent, indicating an excess of
acids, certain alkaline remedies, as the sodium, potassium or ammonium
salts, will increase the influence of these vegetable tonics.

All preparations should be made from the green plant.
Physiological Action—Collinsonia stimulates the stomach, promoting its

RESPIRATORY SEDATIVES AND TONICS 265

own absorption. It is actively tonic in its influence upon the entire function
of this organ, and from this influence its beneficial action is exercised upon
the function of all the vital organs.

Collinsonia acts as a tonic to enfeebled muscular structure of the heart.
It is conspicuous in its ability to overcome relaxed and out of tone conditions of the walls of the veins. It has a direct influence upon atonic and
dilated or otherwise impaired conditions of the veins and arteries.

Specific Symptomatology—in piles with a sense of fullness, or of
a foreign body in the rectum, in all relaxed conditions of the mucous membranes of the lower bowel, collinsonia is the remedy. It works more promptly
if there is passive congestion with blueness or dark discoloration of the membranes, showing imperfect venous capillary circulation.

Collinsonia is given where there is a sensation of constriction, heat and
weight in the rectum; where there is deficient secretion from imperfect capillary circulation in the mucous membranes, the patient passing the feces in
the form of dry scybala.

Therapy—It is a specific remedy for hemorrhoids. If they are of recent
origin they can be cured in a comparatively short time with this agent. The
most intractable cases will be relieved and permanently benefited by its persistent use. There is no therapeutic influence more reliable than this. I
have relied upon it for years.

In catarrhal gastritis, where the circulation is defective, collinsonia,
either alone or combined with hydrastis, is of first importance. These agents
combined improve the tone of the stomach, strengthening its walls and its
mucous membranes, and increasing the strength and character of its glandular structure. They increase the appetite and greatly improve the digestion
and assimilation of food.

This combination is a superb general tonic in relaxed and debilitated conditions, and combined with iron can hardly be excelled.

Acute inflammations do not promptly yield to collinsonia, although it is
an excellent auxiliary to the indicated treatment.:

When piles are operated upon, this remedy may be given before and
after the operation to most excellent advantage. The author has cured many
cases by combining equal parts of the fluid extracts of collinsonia and hamamelis virginica, and giving from twenty to thirty drops of the mixed extracts
every two hours. The distilled extract of hamamelis can be injected into
the rectum, or kept in contact with the external piles by a compress, especially during sleep. Or an occasional application of the liquor of the persulphate of iron in full strength can be made to stubborn external piles.

Collinsonia is of great value in the hemorrhoids of the pregnant female,
with imperfect venous circulation in the pelvic viscera.

Pain in the rectum from whatever cause, especially pain not attributable to a definite cause, and pain after surgical operations or a sensation of
weight, constriction and general uneasiness in the rectum are quickly and
more or less permanently relieved by collinsonia. In pain in the lower bowels, persistent and steady, collinsonia is specific. Either single full doses, or
doses of five minims of the tincture every ten minutes, should be given in
water..It is superior to opium in some cases.

Collinsonia is a heart tonic of direct and permanent influence. It does
not seem to stimulate the heart to sudden action, but its continued use induces steady, permanent and highly satisfactory improvement in the strength
ae character of the organ, and a correspondingly improved general ciration.

It is valuable when the heart is debilitated from protracted fevers, or
from rheumatic inflammation or from overstrain. It will be found excellent

in the bicycle heart, in conjunction with small doses of cactus grand.

In chronic laryngitis or pharyngitis, with relaxed walls of the larynx,
with dark discoloration and enfeebled capillary circulation, collinsonia exercises a specific influence, especially in the condition known as clergyman’s
sore throat, caused or increased by the use of the voice.

In atonic conditions of the circulation of a local character, where passive
hemorrhages are of frequent occurence without apparent cause, where there
is increasing debility, collinsonia and hamamelis in conjunction given as above
indicated are positively curative.

I have made some important observations within the last five years,
and have collected the observations of others, which must be added to our
knowledge ‘of this remedy. Guided by its influence upon the walls of the
veins, I have given it in large doses persistently in the treatment of varicocele,
and have obtained satisfactory results. I would advise that it be given in the
early stage of this difficulty, and if the condition is anticipated in boys, or
youth at the age of puberty, the patient may be put on this remedy and kept
on it, for some time.

My suggestions concerning its positive action in hemorrhoids alone, or
combined with hamamelis, as may be indicated, have been acted upon by
very many physicians who have reported brilliant results, and an increasing
confidence in the remedy.

This agent having a specific influence as suggested above, upon the walls
of both the veins and the arterioles has been my most reliable remedy in the
treatment of varicosis. This may be general or local, it may be permanent
or temporary, as in pregnancy. I have had admirable results with this and
hamamelis combined in the treatment of extreme cases of varicosis of the
vaginal walls and pudenda, during pregnancy. Cases which would certainly
otherwise have demanded an operation before delivery for the patient’s
safety, were cured fully before delivery with no complicating influences. I
would prize it most highly for this result alone.

I had under observation, for a short time, the worst case of epilepsy it
has ever been my lot to treat. The paroxysms, if the patient was not saturated with medicine, would occur many times a day. The patient’s mind ultimately became a blank.

The paroxysms were completely controlled during a period of nearly
two years, by tablespoonful doses of the fluid extract of collinsonia three or
four es daily. Given at the beginning of an attack, it would ward off the
attack.

I have not been able to find many other physicians who have made any
observation of the remedy in the control of convulsions, but it certainly exercised that influence in this case, and therefore should be used in similar
cases, and the results reported. It acted in every way similar to the bromides for which it was given as a substitute.

Other writers attribute anti-spasmodic properties to collinsonia. In the
treatment of chorea, some writers have given it with excellent results, believing it to be superior to macrotys or arsenic in this disease.

In sub-acute proctitis, and muco-enteritis, with dysentery, or following
dysentery, or when dysenteric phenomena are present during cholera infantum, with pain or inflammation in the rectum, this agent is important.

Where operations have been performed upon the rectum for ulcers,
piles, fistula, or the removal of pockets, the consequent soreness is directly
relieved with full doses of collinsonia. Pain in the rectum that cannot be
attributed to any given cause can be relieved by collinsonia. Dr. Scudder
advised the use of this agent in small doses. I have been obliged to give it
in doses of from ten to twenty minims to secure the desired results. I am

confident that the larger dosage will give more satisfaction.

Foltz employed this agent where there was inflammation in the middle
ear, when there was follicular pharyngitis and hypertrophy. of the glands of
the throat. Chronic thickening of these membranes with enlarged capillaries, will be relieved by it.

Shoemaker extols collinsonia in the treatment of acute cystitis. Combined with aconite, he has excellent results. In some cases he combines it
with narcotics, and uses it as a rectal or vaginal injection, or it may be incorporated in a suppository for this purpose. It promptly relieves spasms
of the sphincters and vaginismus.

CALUMBA. JATEORRHIZA PALMATA.

Synonyms—Columbo, Columba.

ConstiTUENTts—Calumbin, a white, bitter, crystalline principle. Berberine, the alkaloid, identical with the alkaloid of Berberis Vulgaris, Calumbie acid.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Calumbee Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Calumba.
Dose, from three to thirty minims.

Tinctura Columbe, ‘Tineture of Calumba. Dose, from twenty minims
to one, or even two drams,

Specific Medicine Calumba. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Physiological Action—This agent is a gastric tonic and one of the typieal stomach bitters. It is believed to increase the flow of the saliva and of
the gastric juice, and increases also the appetite and the power of digestion.
It is an intestinal antiseptic to a limited extent and is anthelmintic.

It is similar in action to hydrastis canadensis, but does not extend its
influence so positively to the nervous system.

Therapy—It is indicated when there is atonicity of the digestive apparatus, especially when there is any irritation whatever. In debilitating
disease of the stomach or bowels it is an excellent remedy. It is restorative
in fevers, improving the general nutrition by the improvement of the tone of
the organs of digestion and assimilation. It is useful after protracted diarrhoas and dysentery, after cholera infantum when a non-irritating tonic is
needed, and in cholera morbus, being of benefit in promoting restoration in
these cases. It will relieve the vomiting of this disease, and a few drops of
the tincture will also relieve vomiting in seasickness, and has been beneficial
in the vomiting of pregnancy.

It is useful in overcoming intestinal flatus, an infusion in inflammatory
intestinal disease being most satisfactory.

In chronic malaria with marked intermittent fever it is valuable.

GENTIANA. GENTIANA LUTEA.

Synonyms—Gentian, Yellow Gentian.

ConstITvENTs—Gentiopicrin, gentisie acid.

PreparaTIoNsS—Extractum Gentiane, Extract of Gentian. Dose, from two
to ten grains.

268 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Physiological Action—Tonic in large doses, irritant, causing nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. The fresh root is more active than the dry.

Therapy—This is a popular stomachic tonic in cases where enfeeblement
has occurred as the result of protracted disease. It has long been given in
combination with other tonics or in wine, as an agent in the dyspepsia of the
aged, or of gouty patients, and in the gastric inefficiency of infants and
children, and to a good advantage in catarrhal diarrhea.

As a tonic to the stomach, and the other organs of digestion and appropriation, in those cases where the system is greatly debilitated by protracted
disease, it is one of the best remedies, especially by exhausting fevers of malarial origin. It is of much value in malarial conditions generally and has
been used to 8 great extent instead of quinine.

When the periodicity has been overcome by quinine this is a rapid restorative to the system.

The tincture of gentian is given freely in conjunction with other tonics
and with alteratives. It is given with the tincture of iron in the treatment
of anemia complicating malarial disease. It is given in conjunction with the
iodide of potassium where a tonic and alterative is demanded, and given
alternately with hydrocyanic or hydrochloric acid, it is sometimes of great
value in the vomiting of pregnancy.

This agent is perhaps the most valuable of this class. It can be depended
upon as a bitter tonic and constant use will establish a confidence in it.

GLYCERINUM.

Synonyms—Glycerin, Glycerine.

Physiological Action—It produces heat in the esophagus and stomach
when swallowed, which to some sensitive patients is exceedingly disagreeable. In greatly excessive doses symptoms not widely different from alcoholic poisoning may be induced.

It is eliminated by the kidneys and will cause dark colored urine, the
quantity of which will be greatly increased. In purges in large doses, and
by abstraction of water from the tissues, a property it possesses to a high
degree, will sometimes induce hydragogue catharsis, especially if introduced
into the rectum.

Therapy—For internal use glycerine is antiseptic, laxative and nutritive, taking the place of cod liver oil to a large extent with children in the
latter particular. This fact is denied, but it is capable of demonstration.

It is valuable diluted with equal parts of water to moisten the dry mouth
and tongue of protracted fevers, and for the removal of sordes. It prevents
decomposition in the stomach and encourages secretion, and if a small quantity be added to ice water and drank regularly in these fevers it is an intestinal antiseptic and nutritive.

In dyspepsia glycerine serves an excellent purpose; holding a fixed
quantity of the peroxide of hydrogen in solution; it is known as Glycozone.
It acts on enfeebled stomachs, especially if there be ulceration or catarrhal
gastritis. It is a most efficient preparation. Glycerine will relieve many
eases of pyrosis and excessive gastric acidity. It is useful in chronic intestinal dyspepsia, especially the flatulent variety and in certain forms of
chronic constipation, stimulating the secretory and excretory functions of
the intestinal glands. It is not yet determined that the above influences depend
on the dehydrating action of the agent.

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE STOMACH 269

Glycerine injected into the bowels produces prompt and satisfactory
evacuation, which renders it valuable with constipated infants, as it stimulates the secretions, encourages normal peristaltic action and may subsequently result in a cure. From half a teaspoonful to a teaspoonful injected
at the same time each morning, or with very young infants morning and
evening, will establish regular habits of evacuation. A larger quantity is
necessary with adults.

Glycerine suppositories are prepared for adults which are often very
convenient.

Introduced into the vagina glycerine will induce a large, in some cases
excessive, watery excretion from the tissues, which is utilized as a local
depletive in many cases of engorgement of the structure of the womb, in
congestion and subinvolution.

Glycerine is applied to fissures and chaps of the skin, and is restorative
to all cutaneous surfaces. It prevents the action of the atmosphere on these
tissues and acts as a lubricant.

It allays itching of the skin and heals many forms of scaly skin disease,
and serves also as a vehicle for the administration of more active skin remedies. It is of much service in eczema, psoriasis, lepra, prurige, herpes and
Pityriasis and will modify the pitting in variola.

It is valuable applied to fissured nipples, to indurated glands and to
erysipelatous inflammation, either of an acute or subacute character.

A foreign writer gives fourteen grains of glycerine for every pound of
the body’s weight in every twenty-four hours, to reduce the excess of uric
acid within the system. He gives this in divided doses in seltzer water three
or four times a day, repeating the treatment when the condition recurs. It
is especially recommended if gravel is present. Hermann of Germany has
experimented on it fully, and believes that the use of large quantities of the
remedy as suggested will not only help expel the small granules formed,
but will assist in dissolving the larger ones, making it possible for them to
pass. At the same time it prevents muscular contraction of the walls of the
passages. The entire influence is desirable.

A physician introduced an ounce of glycerine antiseptically high up in
the womb when desiring to secure premature birth. Five cases out of six,
aborted satisfactorily by this treatment.

EUPATORIUM. EUPATORIUM PERFOLIATUM.

Synonyms—Boneset, Ague Weed.

ConstiTuents—Eupatorin, volatile oil, resin, tannin, wax, gum.

PrePaRATIONS—Extractum Eupatorie Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Eupatorium. Dose, from ten to sixty minims.

Specific Medicine Eupatorium. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Physiological Action—Stimulating tonic, aperient, diaphoretic, emetic,
antiperiodic.

The action of this agent upon the stomach is somewhat unique, differing
in some important particulars from that of other stomach tonics.

Therapy—It is valuable in catarrhal disorders of whatever nature,
whether gastric, intestinal, post-nasal, bronchial or vesical. It has an undoubted soothing influence upon the nervous system, and is of much value in
stomach disorders of nervous origin. In a case of neurasthenia of long standing, complicated with emphysema, the patient, an extremely nervous woman,

persistently regurgitated all the food she took. There was no nausea, no
vomiting; the food simply came back after it was swallowed. Fifteen drops
of the fluid extract of boneset every two hours was given. The second day
the patient was relieved, and there was no return of the disorder after the
fifth day, for several months, when it recurred for a short time, but was
promptly relieved by the same medicine.

In a ease of intractable hiccough in an old man, when every possible
remedy had failed and death seemed inevitable, boneset, fifteen drops in
an infusion of capsicum, every hour, produced a permanent cure.

It is a typical diaphoretic, although not powerful in its action. In intermittent fever of the severest types, in remittent fever, in continued fevers of
any type, and in the exanthemata, given in hot infusion in the early stages,
it produces delightful results.

Dr. Locke says the remedy is specific in masked intermittent fever, in
which there is sluggishness of every function and irregular occurrence of
chill and fever, the fever followed with but little reaction almost no perspiration, but with severe aching in the bones. He uses the infusion, made
by steeping one ounce of the foliage of the plant in a quart of boiling water.
Of this a half teacupful is given every fifteen minutes until the patient
vomits thoroughly. He then puts the. patient to bed and continues the remedy in smaller doses at lengthened intervals until the patient has perspired
for two or three hours, when the medicine is discontinued and tonics are
then given.

In conditions due to malaria, where there is intermittent headache, or
severe irregular browache, where many of the symptoms of ague are present,
this remedy takes precedence over every other.,

LYCOPODIUM. LYCOPODIUM CLAVATUM.

Synonym—Club-moss.

Const1TuENTs—Fixed oil, sugar, volatile base (methylamine), alumina,
phosphoric acid.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Lycopodium. Dose, from one to fifteen

Powdered Lycopodium. For external use.

Tincture of Lycopodium. Dose, from one to twenty minims.

The tincture prepared from the triturated sporules contains to the fullest extent the medicinal principles of the herb.

Physiological Action—The older writers claimed that the agent acted as
a stimulant to the sympathetic visceral system of nerves and influenced the
functional activity of all organs so controlled. It was believed to increase
the tone of the liver, and to restrain over-action of the kidneys and eliminative organs.

Specific Symptomatology—Extreme sensitiveness of organs of special
sense. Pain under the ribs and around the waist; shooting pains under the
shoulder blades; severe pains across the stomach; nausea; vomiting of sour
and bitter food; persistent constipation; painful bleeding piles; coldness of
the extremities; pale, ashy or jaundiced complexion, with dirty skin; in some
cases of flatulence, with distention of the intestines; persistent constipation
of children; irritation of the bowels following an injection; sour stomach
and heartburn; in old standing congestions of the liver, with great desire
to sleep after eating. All conditions accompanied with excess of uric acid
are benefited by it.

AGENTS ACTING UPON THE STOMACH 271

Therapy—The simple powder is used extensively as an application to
tender and irritable conditions of the skin, and as an application to certain
skin diseases to which a dry powder would seem applicable—to intertrigo,
erysipelas, eczema, herpes, and ulcerated surfaces and perhaps to burns. Its
domestic use is in its application to chafed surfaces and as a dusting powder
for infants.

The agent is said to be dependable in its influence upon certain severe
forms of dyspepsia. That common condition present in catarrhal gastritis,
evidenced by soreness on pressure over the stomach, and a sensation of fullness of the stomach when only a little has been eaten, is quickly relieved
by its use.

It is advised in rheumatic conditions, especially if accompanied by any
of the above indications. It is depended upon as a cure for the uric acid
diathesis and in this probably lies its influence upon rheumatism.

Dr. Harrison of Illinois treated several cases of fever that had morning
remissions, but the highest occurred in the middle of the afternoon, in which
the urine was suddenly of a dark red color, and deposited the usual stains
of the urates with considerable uric acid. In another case, there was cerebral and spinal irritation. The urine was similar in all the cases. Small
doses of lycopodium, twenty drops in four ounces of water, a teaspoonful
gvery two hours, was sufficient to modify all the conditions and overcome the

‘ever.

In its action upon the urinary apparatus it relieves urinary incontinence,
especially if caused by an excess of uric acid and the urates, painful urination and vesical catarrh.

It is also serviceable in gonorrhea and in gleet.

CROCUS. CROCUS SATIVUS.

Synonym—Saffron.

ConstITUENTS—Crocin, volatile oil, picrocrocin (saffron bitter), gum, wax,
fat, albumen.

PrEPARATIONS—Tincture Croci, Tinctura Croci, Tincture of Saffron. Dose,
from one to three drams.

Tinctura Serpentarie Composita, Compound Tincture of Serpentaria.
Dose, from ten to sixty minims.

Therapy—Saffron tea was long in good repute among the grandmothers
of our older men as an essential remedy to start new-born babes in normal
health channels. It was thought necessary to encourage the action of the
liver and to cleanse the intestinal canal and stomach. It was positively indicated, if the skin was yellow and in infantile colic.

It has mild diaphoretic, stimulant, antispasmodic and tonic properties.
It may be given in the early stages of fevers, and especially in eruptive fevers, -
in full doses if there is a retrocession of the eruption.

It checks mild cases of irregular uterine hemorrhage, menorrhagia or
metrorrhagia, and encourages the lochial discharge when suppressed after
confinement.

QUASSIA. QUASSIA AMARA.

Synonym—Simaruba Excelsa.

ConsTITUENTS—Quassin. Dose, one-third of a grain.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Quassie Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Quassia.

272 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Physiological Action—The taste of quassia is so intensely bitter that
with some patients it acts as an emetic at once. It stimulates most positively
the salivary, mucous, gastric and intestinal canal. It is an anthelmintic and
parasiticide.

Specific Symptomatology—Extreme inactivity of the digestive and
assimilating organs from debility—a cessation of function from lack of
power, is an indication for the use of this remedy. The evidences are a
broad, flabby tongue, pale, thick, indented with the teeth, sometimes heavily
furred, coated with a dirty white or brownish coat, mucous membranes of
the mouth pale, anorexia, general feebleness.

Therapy—It is one of the best of what is known as ‘‘stomach bitters.’’
In debility of the stomach or intestinal structures, and inactivity of the
secreting organs, the tonic effects of this agent are most pronounced. In
convalescence from severe acute disease, the conditions there often existing
are satisfactorily corrected with this remedy.

Many forms of dyspepsia depending purely upon atonicity, are cured
by the use of quassia, either alone or in conjunction with some of the other
remedies of this group which possess a similar action.

Quassia, by enema, will destroy ascarides. Pin or thread worms in large
quantities may be removed by a single injection of a strong infusion of the

ark,

As these worms infest almost the whole of the large intestine, it is advisable for their complete removal that the patient lie on the left side with
the hips elevated, and that a large quantity of the infusion, not too strong
in this case, but as warm as can be borne, be slowly introduced into the bowel
from a fountain syringe. Tonic remedies internally are advised in conjunction if there is a persistent tendency to their reappearance.

Quassia in infusion will destroy small insects, ants, flies and lice of all
kinds. The pediculus capitis and pediculus pubis are readily destroyed by
frequent washing with a strong infusion of the drug.

SUMACH. RHUS GLABRA.

Synonym—Smooth Sumach.

ConstiTvENTs—Volatile oil, resin, tannic and gallic acid, albumen, gum,
starch. The berries contain malic acid in combination with lime.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Rhois Fluidum (A. D.), Fluid Extract of
Sumach Bark. Dose, from a half to one dram.

Extractum Rhois Glabre Fluidum (U. 8. P.), Fluid Extract of Sumach
Berries. Dose, one dram.

Specific Symptomatology—Its influence is upon mucous surfaces in a
relaxed, ulcerated and phlegmonous, but irritable and intractable condition.

Therapy—It is used in aphthous stomatitis, both internally and externally, in grenous stomatitis in conjunction with more active agents, and
in stomatitis materni it is a good remedy. It will serve a good purpose in
atonic ulcerations of the stomach and intestinal canal, in some cases of prolonged diarrhea and dysentery with greatly debilitated mucous surfaces. Its
field is well covered, however, with more active remedies.

CORNUS. CORNUS FLORIDA.

Synonym—Dogwood.

ConstitventTs—Cornin or cornic acid, resin, gallic acid, tannin.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Corni Floride Fluidum, Fluid Extract of
Cornus Florida. Dose, from a half to two drams.

MILD STOMACH TONICS 273

Specific Medicine Cornus. Dose, from five to sixty minims.

Therapy—This agent is indicated not only to correct the atonic conditions of the glandular structure of the gastro-intestinal apparatus in malaria, but as an antidote to the malarial poison itself. It has marked control over many of the manifestations of malaria.

Its influence upon the stomach in these cases increases the appetite at
once, improves the character of the digestion and relieves the drowsiness
and dullness apt to follow imperfect digestion. It is a tonic in enfeebled
conditions of the stomach from whatever cause and improves intestinal digestion.

Mild Stomach Tonics.
FRASERA. ASARUM. CONDURANGO.
PTELIA, PANAX. INULA.
ALNUS RUBRA. LIATRIS, SACCHARINUM.
FRASERA. FRASERA CANADENSIS.

Synonym—American Columbo.

ConstITUENTs—G@entiopicrin, gentisic acid, two distinct yellow coloring matters glucose, gum, sugar, salts.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Frasera. Dose, from five to thirty

Therapy—This agent operates upon the stomach and digestive apparatus directly, influencing the tone of the glandular organs of the entire
digestive tract. It is a stomachic tonic of considerable power, exercising its
best influence when the apparatus is impaired by protracted disease. Under
these circumstances it is also a stimulant and astringent to the secreting
surfaces, correcting excessive night sweats common to such a condition, controlling the diarrhea and dysentery where there are relaxed and atonic mucous membranes.

In that form of catarrhal gastritis, where there is a sense of fulness in
the stomach after eating even a little food, it improves the digestion and relieves the distress, and where there is marked debility improves the tone
of all the organs.

PTELIA. PTELIA TRIFOLIATA.

Synonym—Wafer Ash.

Const1rvents—Oleoresin, starch, albumen, yellow coloring matter, berberin, volatile oil, salt of lime, potash and iron.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Ptelia. Dose, from one to twenty minims.

Therapy—tThe agent is a mild tonic, exercising a direct influence upon
the stomach and digestive apparatus, correcting certain faults of gastric
secretion, overcoming dyspepsia and improving the appetite. It may be
given to good advantage with other stomachic tonics and iron. It corrects
atonic diarrhea and is of benefit in dysentery, its pungent properties and
sufficient astringency renders it of benefit in mild cases. In full doses it
acts upon the skin as a diaphoretic. It has been given in lung troubles, but
we have other active remedies which produce more gratifying results.

ALNUS. ALNUS RUBRA.

Synonym—Tag Alder.

ConsTITUENTS—Not analyzed.

PrEPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Alnus. Dose, from ‘one to sixty minims.

Therapy—This agent combines both alterative and tonic astringent
properties. It removes waste products, improves the tone of mucous structures and increases the secretory action of the glands of these structures. At
the same time it prevents the flow of an excessive quantity of mucus into
the stomach, and stimulates the flow of gastric juice and aids the digestion.
It cures various forms of ulcerations in the mouth, or in the gastro-intestinal
canal. It is advised in rhus poisoning. It has accomplished satisfactory
cures in pustular and eczematous disease of the skin.

Dr. Ramey of Lincoln, Neb., suggests the use of alnus in the treatment’
of syphilis. He gives it in conjunction with echinacea and stillingia with
successful results. It can be given as high as thirty drops at a dose, four
times a day and will undoubtedly add something to our list of good remedies for this disease.

ASARUM. ASARUM CANADENSE.
Synonym—Wild Ginger.

Dose, from one-half to one dram of the specific medicine.

Dr. Houts claims that asarum is a reliatle emmenagogue, and perfectly
safe. He gives it alone when he needs to restore the menses, and says he
needs nothing with it. It has a direct influence on the uterine system. For
young girls with their early menstruation and in cases of painful menstruation, he uses an infusion of the fresh root and expects to get satisfactory results. He takes one ounce of the root and lets it steep slowly for one hour
in a pint of water and sweetens it. He gives from one to two drams every
half hour or hour. He takes from five to ten drops of the fluid extract to a
cupful of hot sweetened water and gives this every half hour or every one
Ba two hours as the patient needs. The results have established his confilence.

The stimulant properties of this agent are of a local character, acting
directly upon the mucous lining of the intestinal tract, and overcoming
flatulence. It is also a stimulant to the secretory function of the skin, acting as a mild but efficient diaphoretic.

In inflammatory conditions it should be avoided, but after the inflammation has abated, it will mildly stimulate the function of digestion and
food appropriation.

The late Dr. R. S. Newton was quite enthusiastic concerning the action
of this remedy. Other of our writers believe that it has a more important
place than that given by most of our authors. It is advised in strong infusion,
freely given, as a stimulating diaphoretic.

Therapy—In acute nasal catarrh, where the discharge has not appeared,
or has been suppressed, with the usual symptoms of headache and general oppression, muscular aching and general discomfort, it is given with good results. Inflammation of the conjunctiva, from taking cold, where there is profuse and constant lachrymation, will be relieved by it.

In painful or longstanding spasmodic affections of the pulmonary region,
as in whooping cough or bronchitis, it will be advantageous and, at the same
time, it influences the digestive apparatus, correcting nausea, cholera and
diarrhea, which may be present.

MILD STOMACH TONICS 275

Dr. Newton considered its most important influence to be exercised upon
the generative apparatus. It is a stimulant to the muscular structure of the
womb and to the ovaries, and is abortive and an active parturient, and may
be given to good advantage in recent cases of amenorrhoea from cold. During labor, when the pains are excessive, and when there is extreme erythism,
a few drops of the tincture may be put in half a glass of water and a teaspoonful administered every five or ten minutes. It will induce quiet and
render the labor more natural. It works in perfect harmony with small doses
of Macrotys..

In metrorrhagia and in menorrhagia, where the flow is steady but not
free, where there are cutting pains in the abdomen and groin, extending down
the thighs, with aching in the back, the patient nervous and irritable, this
remedy will restore the flow to its normal proportions, will relieve the nerve
tension and subdue pain. Violent pain in the small of the back on the approach of the menstrual epoch, which seems to interfere with the breathing,
is said to be a diagnostic indication for this remdy.

Where there is melancholy and nervous disturbance in the early part of
pregnancy, so that miscarriage seems to be threatened, a teaspoonful of
basadrey every two or three hours will sometimes restore the patient to normal
condition.

PANAX. PANAX QUINQUEFOLIUM.
Synonym—Ginseng.
ConstITUENTS—Panaquilon, gum, resin, starch, albumen.
PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Panax. Dose, from five to sixty minims.
Therapy—This agent is an important article of commerce in China, being
& general domestic remedy and highly prized. It is a mild sedative and tonic
to the nerve centers, improving their tone, if persisted in, and increasing the
eapillary circulation of the brain. It is given in cerebral anemia, and if
combined with other tonics is capable of doing some good. It is also prescribed in the failure of digestion incident to nervous prostration and general nerve irritation.

LIATRIS. LIATRIS SPICTA.

Synonyms—Gay Feather, Colic Root.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Liatris Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Liatris.
Dose, from one-half dram to one dram.

Specific Medicine Liatris. Dose, from ten to sixty minims.

Infusion Liatris. Dose, from one to four drams.

Physiological Action—The agent has the properties, to a mild degree,
of a bitter tonic. It is said to act as an antispasmodic to spasm of the muscular structure of the intestines, relieving spasmodic colic. It stimulates the
kidneys and has been used in dropsies. It may be used in the latter stages
of fevers as an eliminant.

Therapy—Liatris stimulates the stomach mildly, and is a tonic and antispasmodic to the entire gastro-intestinal apparatus, relieving colic and
soothing irritation, after fevers and after other acute prostrating diseases,
restoring healthy glandular action. Its eliminative action is quite marked,
it having been often used in syphilis and scrofula.

It is a prompt diuretic, relieving kidney irritation and assisting in
the removal of dropsical effusions, but we have more direct and efficient
remedies..

CONDURANGO. GONOLOBUS CONDURANGO.

Synonyms—Condurango (Cundur-angu, vine of Condor).

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Condurangonis Fluidum, Fluid Extract Condurango, not miscible with water without precipitation. Dose, one-half to
one fluid dram.

Therapy—The influence of the agent is exercised directly upon the
stomach as a tonic and corrective of perverted action. It is of service in
gastric ulcer and in the early stages of cancer of the stomach, for which it
was originally lauded as a cure. It is depended upon by some enthusiastic
users to retard progress of some cases of this disease, and to relieve distress
and urgent symptoms when fully developed. It cannot be curative. It will
be found of service, probably, in catarrhal gastritis with extreme atonicity
and threatened ulceration. In these cases its virtues as a tonic and restorative will find exercise to the full extent of their influence.

It deserves thorough investigation and faithful trial. It may be given
in the form of a warm decoction with excellent advantage. A winé of condurango is prepared which has good influence upon the stomach. Half an
ounce may be taken with the meals.

A Homeopathic writer gave condurango internally to a man 74 years of
age who had small crusts forming on his lower lip for a long time suggesting
the beginning of cancer. He gave a Homeopathic trituration and satisfactorily cured the case. This remedy being recommended externally should be
tried internally for other cancerous conditions. In the above case a chronic
eatarrh of the stomach where there was vomiting of a green slime after
dinner with hyperacidity and emaciation was inadvertently cured with the
treatment as stated.

Synonym—Elecampane.

ConstITUENTs—Helenin, inulin, volatile oil, acrid resin, bitter extractive.

PreEPARATIONS—Extractum Inulae Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Elecampane. Dose from ten to sixty minims.

Specific Medicine Inula. Dose from five to forty minims.

Administration—The agent is given in infusion to excellent advantage,
and a syrup may be prepared which is serviceable in lung troubles.

Helenin is given in doses of from the one-twelfth to the one-fourth of a
grain four ‘or five times daily.

Physiological Action—The tonic influence of this agent has been recognized for many years. It acts directly upon the nutritive functions of the
body. In general debility from protracted disease or from overwork, or
from age, its influence is plainly apparent. It imparts tone to the digestive
and respiratory organs and to the urinary tract.

Therapy—tIn atonic condition of the abdominal viscera with engorgement great relaxation and general inactivity this agent exercises specific
properties. It influences not only the character of the circulation but acts
also as an alterative, improving the character of the blood. It is of advantage in those atonic conditions where, with great inactivity of the gastro-intestinal tract, there is disorder of the skin and discoloration and eruptions.

The direct tonic influence of inula seems to be exercised also upon the
respiratory tract after protracted disease promoting recovery. It lessens
excessive bronchial secretion controls the night sweats and imparts real tone
and strength.

MILD STOMACH TONICS 277

Hare says that inula has an actively astringent influence. Giving it during the course of cough if there be great secretion the influence is very desirable but if there is but little secretion it makes the cough very tight.

Foreign authorities have written considerable in the last five years on
the action of this agent in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis claiming
that it has a directly toxic action upon the tubercle bacilli. They believe that
a pure alkaloid of inula will exercise a more positive influence than creosote,
or guaiacol preparations. Von Unruh experimented with inula and echinacea
hypodermically (see echinacea). He uses Subculoid inula, from three to five
ec. daily. His first report will be found in The National Quarterly, Volume I,
Number 7. It certainly promises favorably. It must be carefully investigated.
Inula is a useful remedy in certain coughs.

Perhaps the alkaloid inulin will be found superior to the fluid medicine
in these cases. It is certainly an important remedy in the relief of irritation
of the trachea and bronchi. Where there is persistent irritating cough, with
pain beneath the sternum, and abundant expectoration, the condition being
acute or sub-acute in character, and accompanied with some elevation of the
temperature, it will be found serviceable. It is an expectorant of a soothing
character. It is also diuretic and diaphoretic in its general influence. Excessive catarrhal discharges from the bladder are readily controlled by its use,
and vaginal catarrh yields readily to its influence. It acts directly upon the
glands of the cervix uteri and in catarrhal endometritis it speedily overcomes
the glairy mucous discharge and materially improves the condition. Emmenagogue properties are claimed for it but this property has yet to be demonstrated.

Dr. Burd says that he is acquainted with an old German physician who
claimed to have cured forty-seven cases of hydrophobia with elecampane,
without a single failure. The patients had the diagnostic symptoms plainly
marked so that there was no doubt that the disease was present. He made a
very strong decoction of the remedy in sweet milk. He gave half a pint of
it every hour. He claimed that all these patients vomit a peculiar green
vomit, and when this stops the medicine can be discontinued or given in less

quantities. —.
SACCHARINUM.

Formula—C,H,SO,N.

Synonyms—Saccharin, Hydro-orthosulphaminbenzoie acid.

Physiological Action—Saccharin has no toxic influence on the animal
body; when given internally or subcutaneously, is excreted by the kidneys
in an unaltered state. It is therefore not decomposed in the body, nor do the
saliva or the feces contain any traces even after large doses. Unlike benzoic
and salicylic acid, it is not converted into hippuric or salicyluric acid. It has
scarcely any retarding effect on the digestion of either proteids or hydrocarbons, and in fact it is said to increase the diastatic action of malt. When
given in large doses, however, fifty to seventy-five grains, injurious effects or
disturbances of the appetite are sometimes induced. The urine is usually not
altered either in specific gravity, quantity, or in the amount of urea and uric
acid; it, however, does not readily undergo fermentation. The amount of
chlorides in the urine appear to be increased during its use, while the phosphates remain normal. Animals on full diet with the addition of Saccharin
increase in weight.

Therapy—It is given to replace sugar when that agent should be
avoided. Diabetic patients use it freely for sweetening their food and beverages, and in most cases are as well satisfied with it as with sugar. Five grains
will sweeten a cup of coffee as effectually as two teaspoonfuls of sugar. It
sweetens sauces and fruits however acid they may be without chemical change.

It is used in the treatment of obesity, but its utility in this condition is
questionable.

In certain forms of acid dyspepsia it has exercised a mild curative influence.

It conceals the bitter taste of quinine and bitter tonics more effectually
than sugar.

CHAPTER III.

Agents Used in the Relief of Gastric and Intestinal Pain—Gastro Intestinal Sedatives.

DIOSCOREA. GINGER. HORSEMINT.
COLOCYNTH. PEPPERMINT.
DIOSCOREA. DIOSCOREA VILLOSA.
Synonym—Wild Yam.
ConstITUENTsS—Saponin.

PREPARATIONS—Dioscorein. Dose, from one to four grains.

Specific Medicine Dioscorea. Dose, from one to forty minims.

Physiological Action—Antispasmodic and anodyne.

Specific Symptomatology—In sudden spasmodic griping pain in the
stomach and bowels it acts similarly to colocynth, but is more certain in the
severer cases, especially if from malarial causes. It is specific in bilious
colic—in the pain of the passing of gall stones, in mild cases, and is valuable
in spasmodic colic of any kind. Spasmodic pain yields to it readily, but it
is much more certain in pain and muscular spasm of the intestines. Its action
produces either immediate or negative results. If, therefore, there is no
benefit after one or two hours’ use it may be discontinued.

Therapy—In the spasmodic pain of cholera morbus or cholera infantum,
of diarrhea or dysentery it is useful.

In neuralgic dysmenorrhea, in ovarian neuralgia, in cramp-like pains in
the uterus at any time and in severe after pains it often acts satisfactorily,
quickly relieving the muscular spasm. Fifteen drops of the tincture of the
specific dioscorea in half a teacupful of hot water should be drunk at a single
dose, as in acute cases it is much more certain if given in this manner. Five
drops every hour or two can be given with good results in constantly recurring mild colicky pains without apparent cause. When given for after pains
it is usually best to give the tincture in ten drop doses in cold water every
half hour or hour, as the hot infusion may cause too great relaxation of the
uterine muscular structure, and permit severe hemorrhage.

COLOCYNTHIS. CITRULLUS COLOCYNTHIS.

Synonym—Colocynth.

ConstitvENts—Colocynthin, extractive, fixed oil, resin, gum, pectin, calcium and magnesium phosphate.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Colocynthidis, Extract of Colocynth. Dose,
from one-half to two grains.

Extractum Colocynthidis Compositum, Compound Extract of Colocynth.
Dose, from five to twenty grains.

Specific Medicine Colocynth. Dose, from one-twentieth to three minims.

AGENTS FOR GASTRIC AND INTESTINAL PAIN 279

Physiological Action—Hydragogue cathartic, tonic. In excessive doses
it causes violent emesis, catharsis, bloody stools, severe burning colicky
pains, spasms, and in some cases death.

Dr. Cressman of Illinois reported a case poisoned by colocynth. The patient was taken with violent pain in the stomach and bowels, followed immediately by vomiting. The bowels moved once, then. The tongue was
clean; the pupils were dilated; pulse weak and rapid; respiration short; skin
cool and moist; intense frontal headache. The pain in the extremities increased with the pain in the back. In twenty-four hours the pulse was weak,
temperature subnormal, bowels moving every fifteen or twenty minutes,
movements streaked with blood, headache very intense, tenesmus extreme.
By hypodermics of morphine for the pain, and carbolic acid and subnitrate
of bismuth for the intestinal disturbance, she slowly recovered, but subnormal
temperature continued for several days.

Specific Symptomatolgy—Acute, cutting pains in the stomach and bowels
in infants—in otherwise perfect health. Intestinal derangements denoted by
screams and sharp crying out in sleep, persistent crying and screaming with
drawing up of the legs in very young babes. Spasmodic pain of all kinds in
the stomach or bowels.

Therapy—Five drops of the tincture in half a glass of water, a teaspoonful every fifteen minutes, will cure infantile colic with the above symptoms in
an hour. It is serviceable in all forms of colic in these small doses, whether
from the liver, stomach or the intestines, if the pain is sharp, quick and of a
cutting character. It will cure neuralgic colic wherever located, and also
some cases of idiopathic neuralgia.

In large doses it is cathartic and depressant in its action, slowing the
heart and reducing the temperature and at the same time producing great
irritation, consequently feebleness and inflammation are contraindications to
its use.

In bilious dyspepsia, so-called, with distension or a feeling of fullness
in the stomach after eating, it is a good remedy in minute doses given after
meals. The tincture is a better remedy than the specific, as the latter is too
active. It is a good plan to dilute it for every day prescribing, in the proportion of one dram to nine drams of dilute alcohol. Of this ten minims in a
four-ounce mixture will produce excellent results.

Colocynth is advised for ovarian trouble where the pain is sharp and cutting; where the ovaries are enlarged and tender from neuralgia. Also during menstruation if the pain is griping, spasmodic, sharp, and severe. Ten
drops in a four-ounce mixture, a teaspoonful every half hour or hour. In
the latter case better results may be secured by adding to the mixture ten or
fifteen drops of dioscorea.

ZINGIBER. ZINGIBER OFFICINALE.

Synonym—Ginger.

ConsTITUENTS—V olatile oil, resin, starch, gum, gingerol.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Zingiberis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Ginger.
Dose, from ten to thirty minims. Oleoresin Zingiberis, Oleoresin of Ginger.
Dose, from a half to one minim.

Tinctura Zingiberis, Tincture of Ginger. Dose, from fifteen to sixty
minims, diluted with water.

Infusum Zingiberis, Infusion of Ginger, prepared by adding a teaspoonful of powdered ginger to half a pint of hot water. Drunk at once, it acts
as an emetic and diaphoretic.

## Page 269

280 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Physiological Action—This agent is mentioned in but few therapeutic
works, although it occupies an important place, and should not be neglected.
It is a profound and immediate stimulant, an active diaphoretic, an anodyne
in gastric and intestinal pain, and a sedative to an irritated and overwrought
system when there is extreme exhaustion. An infusion of the powder drunk
warm produces immediate but mild emesis and active diaphoresis.

Administration—Ginger is an emergency remedy. In every case in
which brandy or whisky is given to produce an immediate stimulating influence, the tincture of ginger can be given with even better results. From
half a teaspoonful to a teaspoonful will produce greater stimulation than half
an ounce of brandy. It may be stirred into half a glass of cold water, but
is much more immediate in its action if given in hot water. The tincture does
not produce emesis.

Therapy—tThe agent stimulates the stomach actively, producing a pleasing sense of warmth. It overcomes flatulence and quickly relieves flatulent
colic. In atonic conditions of the stomach and intestinal tract, it stimulates
the structure to renewed activity and materially assists in the restoration of
normal tone. It relieves pain from any cause except inflammatory action,
when this remedy must be avoided.

In acute colds the entire train of symptoms may be aborted in a single
night, by advising the patient to take a hot mustard foot bath at bedtime,
while the body, prepared for bed, is wrapped in warm blankets. During the
foot bath the patient should drink a glass or two of hot water, each of which
contains half of a dram of the tincture of ginger.

Acute inflammations may be aborted by this course. In dysmenorrhea,
ovarian neuralgia and uterine pain from any cause at the menstrual epoch,
this agent is reliable. If given at the beginning of an hysterical attack it will
often abort the attack, and produce quiet and restful sleep.

Its influence as a rubifacient is slow and by no means as satisfactory as
mustard, and it is now seldom used as a counter-irritant.

MENTHA. MENTHA PIPERITA.

Synonym—Peppermint.

ConstITUENTs—Volatile oil, resin, tannin, gum.

i PreparaTions—Aqua Menthe Piperite, Peppermint Water. Dose, ad
abitum.

Olium Menthe Piperite, Oil of Peppermint. This is a volatile oil prepared from the fresh herb by distillation with steam—a greenish-yellow
liquid, having a pungent odor and taste. Dose, from one to fifteen minims.

Physiological Action—Peppermint is a powerful diffusible stimulant,
carminative, antispasmodic, stomachic, and in the form of the volatile oil a
local anesthetic.

Specific Symptomatology—Flatulent colic, gastrodynia, nausea, vomiting, spasmodic pain in the bowels, hiccough, palpitation from indigestion,
griping, cholera morbus, cholera infantum, spasmodic cholera, irritability of
the stomach, diarrhea with abdominal pain, nervous headache, painful gonorrhea.

Therapy—In fevers of an inflammatory character caused by exposure to
cold and damp, with nausea and vomiting, a warm infusion of peppermint
may be given to produce perspiration and promote a cure, as it is a very efficient diaphoretic.

The oil of peppermint, on account of the menthol present in it, is a local
anesthetic, and may be employed to relieve local pain, as in the inflamed

AGENTS FOR GASTRIC AND INTESTINAL PAIN 281

joints of rheumatism, as a spray in painful inflammation of the throat and
fauces, and in any painful condition where a direct application of the angsthetic can be made.

Where the food tends to ferment in the stomach and bowels, it may be
given in doses of three to five minims in capsules, as an antiseptic to prevent
fermentation and promote digestion.

When a local application of the oil of peppermint is made, the parts,
where practicable, should be covered with oiled silk or rubber cloth to prevent evaporation.

A spray of oil of peppermint may be inhaled with relief of many of the
distressing symptoms incident to asthma and chronic bronchitis of the aged.

Oil of peppermint applied to carious teeth will promptly relieve the pain
of toothache. The cavity should be dried and a pledget of cotton saturated
with the oil placed in it.

In the extreme irritability of the stomach in cholera morbus and in painful stasis of the stomach and bowels, the spirit of peppermint may be given
at frequent intervals in hot, sweetened water, while hot fomentations should
be applied to the abdomen at the same time.

In the pain of acute indigestion, and in painful diarrhea and dysentery,
while peppermint will prove a valuable analgesic it is more important to the
safety of the patient to empty the stomach with an emetic of the compound
powder of lobelia, or move the bowels with a cathartic of sulphate of soda;
when the cause is removed the pain and danger will pass away.

In burns and scalds peppermint is both soothing and curative, the parts
being kept wet with it. It is a stimulating dressing, but is not objectionable
on this account.

In rectal pruritus, and in painful papillary growths at the orifice of the
female urethra, either the oil of peppermint or menthol may be employed as
a local anesthetic to relieve the itching and pain.

In painful bowel complaints with inflammation—pain on pressure, tongue
dry, with reddened tip and edges, peppermint should not be given. In any
case if the remedy does not afford relief in a reasonable time it should be
discontinued.

MONARDA. MONARDA PUNCTATA.

Synonym—Horsemint.

ConstiITUENTS—A dark-yellow volatile oil which contains thymol. Soluble
in alcohol. Dose, from one to five drops.

Physiological Action—In its general influence monarda punctata is a
pure active stimulant of a diffusible character; a few drops of the oil on the
tongue will produce a stimulation which will be felt at the tips of the fingers
in a few minutes. It stimulates the nervous system and increases the heart’s
action, taking the place of alcoholic stimulants to a great extent. The
essence, tincture or infusion are all prompt in their action. It soothes
nervous excitement when due to exhaustion, promoting sleep and rest. Upon
the stomach, in whatever form taken, it is a stimulant tonic and carmina-

‘ive.

Therapy—It soothes gastric and intestinal pain in the absence of inflammation, especially in Cholera Morbus and overcomes nausea and vomiting. It
controls diarrhea from debility with relaxation of the mucous structures of
the intestinal canal.

The agent is efficient in the control of vomiting due to exhaustion, or
persistent nausea with flatulence present in dilated stomach, or the vomiting
of alcoholics, in whom it will, in part, supply the craving for liquor, and im-

part a temporary tone to the stomach and nervous system. Dr. Laws claimed
to prevent fully, all nauseating influence of lobelia and ipecac by this agent
and from this influence he learned to try it in all cases of vomiting, usually
with much satisfaction. He believed its influence controls irritability of the
pneumogastric.

It may be given with turpentine or gautheria in extreme atonicity of
the intestinal tract in protracted fevers with tympanites. It is to some extent a diaphoretic, and has also a diuretic action which is important in these
fevers.

The agent has been used to considerable extent as an emmenagogue,
and is sometimes efficient in simple retention of the menses from cold.

Note—As sedatives to nausea and gastric irritation, other agents, as
hydrocyanic acid, ingluvin, ferrocyanide of iron, and ipecac in small doses,
are efficient, and this property is fully described in the consideration of the
therapy of those agents in other chapters.


Agents Used as Sedatives to Gastric Irritation—Anti-Emetics.

AMYGDALUS PERSICA. BISMUTH SUBGALLATE. ARSENIC OXIDE.
BISMUTH SUBNITRATE. OXALATE OF CERIUM.
AMYGDALUS. AMYGDALUS PERSICA.

Synonym—tThe Peach Tree.. -PrePaRATIONS—Tincture Amygdalus Persica. Dose, from ten to sixty


Specific Medicine Amygdalus. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Therapy—The older physicians suggested this remedy as specific to irritation in the stomach, with persistent nausea and vomiting, especially valuable in childhood where the tongue was elongated and pointed, the edges
red and the stomach tender on pressure. It has invariably disappointed the
author, but other physicians use it with much confidence. It is said to relieve
nervous vomiting and the vomiting of pregnancy, and the persistent vomiting of cholera infantum. It is sometimes best given in strong infusion of
the bark of the green twigs. The influence claimed for this by Scudder has
not been confirmed by more recent observers.

BISMUTH SUBNITRATE.

Synonym—Subnitrate of Bismuth.

This salt is formed from purified bismuth, by the action of nitric acid
in the presence of distilled water.

Physiological Action—It is a mild and soothing agent in its local influence upon the skin and inflamed mucous surfaces. Internally its influence
is confined almost exclusively to the gastro-intestinal mucous membranes.

The agent is not entirely devoid of toxic properties, when applied very
extensively to large, open wounds. It sometimes produces poisonous effects
owing to a not uncommon adulteration with a salt of arsenic. It has produced gastro-intestinal irritation and symptoms or arsenic poisoning. Des-

AGENTS FOR GASTRIC IRRITATIONS 288

quamative nephritis with albuminous urine has occurred from its free and
long continued use.

In all cases where its use is persisted in, it produces a greenish or black
discoloration of the feces, and an odor of garlic upon the breath which is
due partly to decomposition of the salt and partly to the presence of tellurium.

Therapy—It is applicable in all cases of vomiting from local irritation.
It has long been in use for this purpose.’ It is one of the best known remedies in chronic catarrh of the stomach with much nausea and the secretion
of large quantities of mucus. The writer has used an arbitrary combination
of this salt with an equal part of ingluvin in all cases of irritation of the
stomach. The combination is much more serviceable than either agent alone,
and is applicable to very many conditions particularly to the summer complaints of children with extreme and persistent nausea.

In these cases it is well to add half a teaspoonful of this powder to half
a glass of water, and after thoroughly stirring it, to administer a teaspoonful every few minutes for an hour or two, all other remedies being suspended. When the irritation is controlled, the agent should be continued
for a short time in alternation with other necessary remedies.

Its influence is not confined to the stomach alone, but extends to the intestinal mucous surface, where it materially assists in controlling many forms
of diarrhea through the astringent properties of the bismuth.

In the use of bismuth subnitrate for the cure of chronic gastric catarrh,
large doses are necessary. Fifteen grains of the pure salt, given once in
three or four hours, is of more service than five grains often repeated.

It is useful also in pyrosis, in gastric flatulence and in extreme acidity
of the stomach especially from the presence of lactic and butyric acids.

In diarrheas, where extreme relaxation is present with lack of tone in
the intestinal membranes, this agent is of but little value as it lacks tonic
properties.

When the tongue is clean and the bowel movements are watery, Liquor
Bismuth is indicated in dram doses, after each stool.

As an external application, bismuth is one of the most valuable remedies. It forms a most perfect dusting powder for chafings and excoriations
especially in young infants. It is applicable also to the skin of the face when
easily chapped or when sensitive from shaving, and to chapped hands.

Incorporated in an ointment of lanolin, is is excellent applied to cracked
and fissured nipples. It should be kept constantly applied, any excess being
wiped off before nursing, and the ointment fully reapplied afterward.

This ointment is most superior as an application to superficial burns.
After the pain and heat are reduced by the application of a carbonate, if this
ointment is kept constantly applied to the burned surface, the healing is
very rapid and the cicatrix is in some cases scarcely perceptible, usually no
contraction of tissue taking place.

Although antiseptic properties are not ascribed to the remedy, pus is
not likely to form when it is used. Where an active antiseptic is needed,
boric acid may be incorporated with it. An ointment of this character is
applicable to eczema of the moist variety. If applied, and the surface closely
covered, healing in some cases takes place with great rapidity. In eczema of
the scrotum and anus, this agent is applicable, and in piles of an acute or
sub-acute character, it renders excellent service. It is applicable to fissures
of the anus and to ulcerated conditions within the rectum, especially if there
are offensive and irritating discharges.

284 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

BISMUTH SUBGALLATE.

Synonyms—Subgallate of Bismuth. Dermatol.

Specific Symptomatology—Thornton says it is a specific in gastric troubles, usually those of a sub-acute character, in which there are a white
tongue, acid eructations, feeling of weight in the stomach after meals
—_ploating, diarrheal discharges at irregular intervals, general dilation of
vessels.

Therapy—This agent performs the function of the subnitrate in nearly
every particular, but is more actively astringent and antiseptic. Although
toxic properties have not yet been observed to any great extent, they are
undoubtedly present in the agent. In all conditions in which iodoform has
been used in surgery, this agent has been substituted with results in most
cases equally as satisfactory. It apparently acts in a similar manner, destroying the ptomaines, and thus rendering the germ inert. In an ointment
with lanolin or with equal parts of lanolin and zine ointment, in the proportion of one dram of this substance to the ounce, its use is advised in all the
cases we have named for the subnitrate. It is praised for its action upon
moist eczema. In all the cases of gastric and intestinal inflammation, and
as an agent to control vomiting, this agent is used in much the same manner
as the subnitrate, in doses of from three to ten grains.

CEROUS OXALATE.

Synonym—Oxalate of Cerium.

Administration—The salt may be given in doses of one grain every three
hours. Three grains three times daily may serve the purpose. Eight grains
is the maximum dose. It may be given in pill form or in a capsule. Large
doses are sometimes effectual where small doses fail.

Therapy—The agent is a sedative to gastric irritation, controlling vomiting. Although acting similarly to bismuth subnitrate is has a wider action,
through its influence as a nerve sedative, thus being especially advantageous
in reflex vomiting. In vomiting of pregnancy it is commonly used; also in
the vomiting or nausea present in hysteria and in uterine disorders and displacements. As a local gastric sedative, it is given in pyrosis, in acid dyspepsia, in catarrhal gastritis, especially if there are nervous complications
and in small doses in vomiting of cholera infantum.

In the disordered stomach of chronic wasting diseases—phthisis, chronic
diarrheas and chronic nephritis—it is sometimes advantageously used.

That the agent has an influence upon the nerve centers is proven by the
fact that it effectually controls some cases of chorea, and has been given advantageously in other forms of nerve irritation, and in epilepsy. It must be
given in full maximum doses of the pure salt to obtain good results in these

ARSENIO. ACIDUM ARSENOSUM.

Synonyms—aArsenous acid, Arsenic trioxide, Arsenicum album, white
Arsenic.

Physiological Action—In its physiological action this agent is a caustic
poison. It acts as an escharotic and local irritant. When a poisonous dose
has been taken there is salivation, metallic taste in the mouth, nausea, vomiting, great pain, with diffused soreness and intense burning in the stomach,


<!-- chunk -->

AGENTS FOR GASTRIC IRRITATIONS 285

which radiates from this organ outward throughout the abdomen. It produces irregular heart action, palpitation, feeble pulse, shallow, rapid and oppressed breathing, edema and albuminuria.

The skin becomes cold and covered with a cold, clammy sweat. Finally,
delirium and convulsions occur and are followed by death.

Almost all the phenomena of cholera in extreme cases, are apparent in
the symptoms of arsenic poisoning.

In medicinal doses the agent increases the appetite and digestion,
stimulating the intestinal glands to increased secretion and encouraging peristaltic action. It stimulates the function of the brain and the central
nervous system, producing a feeling of exaltation and exhilaration. Its tonic
influences are quite marked. While power to improve the condition of the
blood is attributed to it, the manner in which this improvement occurs is
not understood.

Specific Symptomatology—It is especially indicated where there is a
general plethoric or engorged condition, or an cedematous condition of the
cellular tissues, with a deficiency of normal elasticity. This condition when
resulting from malarial influences, or from inactive liver and spleen, is especially susceptible to the action of this remedy.

In its absorption by the stomach, Ringer says if that organ is empty the
arsenic enters the veins and is carried directly to the liver. If there is food
in the stomach, the agent is absorbed by the lacteals, and is thence poured
into the blood current.

Therapy—In dyspepsia from general atonicity of the stomach, arsenic
taken before meals will stimulate this organ, promoting the flow of the digestive fiuids, and materially improving its tone. It is a common remedy in
the treatment of gastralgia and in ulcer of the stomach.

In that form of chronic indigestion which induces a necessity for an
immediate evacuation of the bowels, quite common to some debilitated patients and to children, this agent is of specific value. It relieves the increased peristaltic action induced by the presence of food, which is the
cause of the food being expelled before it is digested. In these cases the
digestion is increased, rapid absorption of the food takes place and the patient shows an improvement in general nutrition. The agent should be
given in small doses before meals, one drop of Fowler’s solution being
usually sufficient.

In chronic ulceration and cancer of the stomach it alleviates the pain
and relieves the vomiting. It is useful in all cases of vomiting. The vomiting of cholera and of cholera infantum are relieved by it.

The reflex vomiting of pregnancy and the regurgitation of food, common to neurasthenic and hysterical patients, is sometimes cured with arsenic when other agents have failed.

It has been highly commended in treatment of the vomiting of alcoholics. Given in proper doses in these cases and persisted in it restores the tone
of the stomach, improves the digestion and materially increases the appetite. It is used in the treatment of alcoholism in combination with other
measures.

In membranous dysmenorrhea this agent is of much service, and Simpson claims that the agent is specific to that form of diarrhea in women in
which with copious evacuations from the bowels, there are shreds and particles of membrane freely discharged, a condition which results in great
emaciation and nervous exhaustion.

In the treatment of cholera, arsenic has been experimented with very
widely. It has been used both in large, and in homeopathic doses. In the


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 275

286 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

latter form very much has been claimed from its use. In small or medium
doses, it will, without doubt, materially assist the cure.

The agent is useful in jaundice due to malaria, where there is catarrh
of the bile ducts, also in overcoming duodenal catarrh. Often repeated doses
of arsenic, not exceeding the 1/100 of a grain, triturated with sugar of milk,
are exceedingly efficacious in some cases of watery diarrhea, with greenish
discharges. This influence is thoroughly accomplished in the use of the arsenite of copper, to which the reader is referred.

Arsenic has won considerable reputation as an antiperiodic. In that
class of cases in which there is marked impairment of the sympathetic nervous system, it imparts tone to the nervous centers. It is especially adapted
if the paroxysms are of irregular occurrence, or erratic in character. Small
doses will accomplish good results in such cases, even better than large ones.
The functions of the stomach, liver and other glandular organs are improved at the same time.

In the treatment of diseases of the skin arsenic is in common use. It
is adapted to all scaly eruptions and to chronic eczema. It is useful in
psoriasis, in pemphigus and lichen. In that form of eczema which affects the
soft tissues, such as those of the anus, scrotum and vulva, it is especially
applicable. If satisfactory results from this agent in full doses do not soon
occur, better results may be obtained if the dose be decreased.

Fowler’s Solution applied freely will cure warts. In the case of long
standing, large warts, give from seven to ten drops internally three times

aily.

Although arsenic has been long used in chorea, it is not so advised by
Ec]ectic clinicians, other methods available to them being more successful.

Dr. Lester reports the application of arsenious acid, full strength, into
the cavity of a tooth to destroy the nerve. The patient had for some time
been affected with paralysis of the left side of the body and face. He then
had tonic spasm of the right side of the body. These would relax after a
short time to recur. He had suffered with these for four years. Immediately after the application of the acid to the tooth, he said, ‘‘Look, I can
move my hand,’’ and slowly the power came back first to the fingers and
thumb; then to the left foot. At the time of the report every condition was
slowly improving, especially was the sight returning to the left eye which
had been blind from the paralysis. This is a well authenticated case.

LIQUOR POTASSIL ARSENITIS.

Synonym—Solution of the Potassium Arsenite, Fowler’s solution.

Administration—This solution, probably the most common of the arsenic solutions and the most convenient for administration, contains one per
cent of arsenious acid. Although ten minims is given as the maximum dose,
we would advise, however, that a dose above five minims be always given

with caution. Our range of administration is from one-fourth of a minim to
five minims.

STOMACH EVACUANTS 287

Agents Used as Evacuants of the Stomach—Emetics.

EUPHORBIA. COPPER SULPHATE.
MUSTARD. ZINC SULPHATE.
EUPHOBBIA. EUPHORBIA COROLLATA.

Synonym—Large flowering Spurge.

Constitvents—Euphorbin glucoside, resin.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Euphorbia. Dose, from one to ten

Physiological Action—Emetic, diaphoretic, expectorant, epispastic. In
large doses it causes emeto-catharsis, and in some cases inflammation of the
stomach and bowels.

Therapy—Though euphorbia acts as an emetic it is but little used for
that purpose, being too harsh in its action, inducing hydragogue catharsis
at the same time. While in extreme doses it may cause acute gastro-enteritis, in small doses it stimulates normal functional activity of the stomach,
influencing the glandular function of the entire gastro-intestinal tract. In
the atonic dyspepsia of enfeebled conditions of the stomach, with bad breath,
bad taste in the mouth, furred tongue, anorexia and constipation with a
sense of weight in the stomach, and occasional colicky pains in the bowels,
it is a good remedy. Ten drops of the tincture in two ounces of water, a
teaspoonful every two hours, will relieve this common train of symptoms. It
has been used in cholera infantum and other summer diarrheas of children
with good results. It is advised in the tenesmus of dysentery, and in the
diarrhea of exhausting diseases.

SINAPIS ALBA.
SINAPIS. SINAPIS NIGRA.

Synonyms—Mustard, white, black or yellow Mustard.

PREPARATIONS—Powdered Mustard. Oil of Mustard. Dose, from onetwentieth to one-tenth of a minim.

ConstITUENTS—Volatile oil.

Physiological Action—Mustard is emetic, stimulant and actively revulsive with marked anodyne properties. Its application to the skin produces
intense burning, violent inflammation, and if persisted in too long, sloughing or ulceration. Taken into the stomach in large quantities, if emesis be
not produced, it causes a burning sensation and a mild form of gastritis.

Specific Symptomatology—For external application it is indicated in
acute cutting pain local in character, usually intermittent and usually
present as the result of rapidly developing acute inflammation, but dull,
steady and constant pains or soreness, slowly developing and persistent, are
not readily relieved by its application. Turpentine externally is of service in
these cases.

Internally it is indicated to excite vomiting when non-corrosive poisons
have been taken, when a foreign body is lodged in the esophagus, or when
there is great distress from an overloaded stomach.

Administration—In the use of mustard for counter-irritation, in cases
of acute pain, it is desirable to obtain its sharp effects as quickly as possible.
In order to do this, a fresh article should be procured, one in which the
pungency is sharply indicated by its action on the nostrils and eyes, since

mustard kept in a paper package on the shelves for weeks is inert from loss
of the volatile oil. Vesication must be avoided, as the blisters thus caused
are of no advantage, and exceedingly painful and difficult to heal. The
white of an egg rubbed up with mustard and a little water, will produce a
poultice which will not readily blister.

When mild counter-irritation only is desired, which is to be prolonged
for some hours, a poultice is made in the proportion of one part of mustard
to four or six of linseed meal or flour. This is not, however, effective in
acute pain, but only where there is soreness or prolonged distress. Vinegar
and mustard also make a good poultice for prolonged use, as vinegar destroys an excess of activity of the mustard. p

For a hot mustard pediluvium, a tablespoonful of the powder is stirred
into a gallon or two of hot water, in which the feet are immediately immerse

For a general mustard bath, two or three tablespoonfuls of mustard
are mixed in a full bath. For a child one tablespoonful will be sufficient,
care being taken to protect the eyes of the patient from the vapor.

Therapy—A teaspoonful of mustard in a bowl of warm water will produce active and immediate emesis. This should be followed by another bowl
of warm water alone, which will continue the evacuation and wash out any
remaining mustard, as even then the burning sensation from the local effects
of this substance with a few patients is hard to bear. Emesis must be obtained as soon as possible after the ingestion of the mustard. An emetic
dose must not be allowed to remain in the stomach, as inflammation may
follow.

Mustard has but little therapeutic influence when administered internally. It does not seem to increase the tone of the gastro-intestinal canal, or
promote the action of the secretory or excretory glands, or assimilative organs, to any great extent, but its external use is common.

In the treatment of acute pleuritis a warm poultice applied over the affected side’ sufficiently large to much more than cover the diseased area,
will usually relieve the pain at once, and a large poultice is always more
effective than a small one. It may be necessary to repeat its application
within twenty-four hours, but if vigorous direct treatment is adopted, this
is seldom necessary.

In bronchitis or pneumonitis in the initiatory stages, a quick poultice
of mustard will exercise a good influence, but it does not give the immediate
relief experienced in pleuritis or pneumonitis where acute pain is a prominent symptom. It should be followed, in the former conditions, as soon as
the sensitiveness of the skin will allow, by persistent heat, moist or dry, as
seems indicated.

In acute pain in the heart, either in angina pectoris or from other cause
a sharp mustard poultice is essential.

In acute stomach pains and in intestinal colic, or pain in the abdomen
from any cause, a large hot mustard poultice will be of much service. In
all cases where mustard is used it is only auxiliary to other prompt treatment, as its influence is usually transient.

A most efficient measure in congestive headache, or in headache from
any cause with fullness of the cerebral vessels, is a mustard poultice on the
nape of the neck.

Spinal irritation is most effectively treated by the use of a succession
of these poultices. On the first day of the treatment one is applied on the
back, across the upper third of the spine; on the second day across the
middle third, and on the third day across the lower third, producing thorough sharp counter-irritation but no blistering. On the fourth day it is ap-

plied at the top of the spine again and the same course followed as before.
This may be continued for two weeks or more if the skin is sufficiently restored in the interim, between the poultices. This course will most materially assist other measures adopted in the treatment of this condition.

A hot mustard foot bath is of great service in congestive chill, also in
the chill at the onset of acute fever, or acute inflammation of any character.
It produces immediate derivation, assists in equalizing the circulation, acts
as a diaphoretic and perceptibly checks the progress of the disease.

In the recession of the rash of eruptive fevers no measure is more
prompt than a general hot mustard bath, which should be continued until a
mild redness covers the entire body.

At the onset of acute cerebro-spinal meningitis the disease has been
completely aborted by the prompt use of a hot mustard bath. In some cases
the patient may be wrapped in a blanket wrung out of hot mustard water,
until the skin is reddened.

In conditions where there is a constant tendency for the skin of the
legs to become cold, and the muscles to cramp during the night, a hot mustard foot bath at bedtime is of direct benefit.

In arrest of the menses from cold, a sitz bath strong with mustard will
sometimes produce an immediate restoration of the flow. It is always of
assistance to other measures. It is sometimes necessary to take this bath
each night for a week preceding the time the menses should appear and
continue it until that result is obtained.

COPPER SULPHATE.

Formula—CuSO,

Synonyme—Blue ‘Vitriol, Bluestone.

Therapy—Given in doses of five grains dissolved in water the sulphate
of copper is a prompt emetic, acting quickly and without irritation. It is
used, though but seldom now for any purpose, in the same conditions for
which the sulphate of zinc is advised, except as an emetic for the evacuation of the stomach after poisons are taken.

It was claimed that its influence in small doses upon the stomach would
increase the flow of gastric juice, as it does of saliva in the mouth and also
of the intestinal juices. Its use is limited by the irritation produced even
by small doses. It has been advised in gastric ulcer, in atonic conditions of
the stomach and bowels with loose, watery diarrheeas.

This agent is one of the chemical antidotes for phosphorus in poisoning
by that agent. It is administered carefully, as the agent itself is poisonous.

Externally it acts upon raw surfaces and open sores and wounds as a
caustic and antiseptic, and is somewhat painful and irritating in its action.
It serves a good purpose in solutions of one grain to the ounce of distilled
water in purulent inflammations of the eyes, and in all catarrhal and ulcerative conditions of mucous membranes wherever located.

ZINC SULPHATE.
Pormula—ZnSO,,.

Physiological Action—This agent is an active irritating emetic. It is
used when profound and immediate emesis is necessary, as after the ingestion of poisons. When given in overdoses, the vomiting is extreme and there
is persistent retching. If the stomach is in a state of irritation when evacua-

tion seems imperative, the stomach pump or irrigation should be used and
this agent should be avoided.

Therapy—With a very torpid stomach, heavy coating on the tongue,
and pale, flabby mucous membranes, this agent will produce a good result,
by arousing the action, unloading morbid secretion and stimulating the nervous influence of the stomach, but vegetable emetics devoid of irritating
properties will accomplish the same result in a much more satisfactory
manner.

It was in use at one time in the treatment of gastric catarrh. It was
given in small doses, probably not exceeding one-fourth of a grain. It should
be beneficial in this disease from its inherent properties, but we have not
used it in this condition because we have not needed it.

It has been given as an emetic in membranous croup, and in spasmodic
croup and whooping cough and in other laryngeal disorders. The agent has
antiseptic properties, is very astringent, and is said to be tonic to the surfaces to which it is applied. It is widely used as a topical application or as
an injection or wash.

It is so used in gonorrhea with hydrastis in the proportion of about
one grain to the ounce. It is used in leucorrhea, and in other catarrhal or
purulent discharges. An excellent combination for the eyes is made by dissolving one grain of hydrastine hydrochlorate and five grains of zinc sulphate in an ounce of rosewater. From five to ten drops of this is slowly
instilled into the eye twice daily. It is useful in purulent conjunctivitis. It
is used for indolent ulcers and gangrene, and the dried salt is made into an
ointment for application to urethral caruncles, warts and fungoid growths,
in lupus and in condylomata. In these cases at least one-fourth of the ointment should be of the sulphate. It should be used with care. In ulcers a
much milder ointment may be used.

CHAPTER VI.

Acids Used for their Direct Influence Upon the Gastro-Intestinal Canal.

HYDROCHLORIC ACID. SULPHURIC ACID.
NITRO-HYDROCHLORIC ACID. AROMATIC SULPHURIC ACID.
NITRIC ACID. TARTARIC ACID.

Physiological Action of Mineral Acids.

These agents are all destructive to organic bodies. They abstract water
from the tissues rapidly, coagulate the albumen and destroy protoplasm.
The weaker solutions are irritant, vesicant and astringent. Increased in
strength they produce local inflammation and in full strength they produce
rapid disintegration of tissue structure.

The physiological action is obtained by the administration of medicinal
doses of the dilute acids always further diluted with an abundance of water.
As one of the evidences of their absence in the system is a deficiency of
secretion, so their administration increases the secretions of all the gastrointestinal glands and glandular organs. The mouth becomes moist from
an increased flow of saliva, the digestive fluids increase in quantity and the
appetite is improved. Their continued use may overstimulate the salivary
glands, but there is a reaction on the part of the gastro-intestinal glands resulting in greatly lessened secretion. They have astringent properties and
will ultimately constipate the bowels.

ACIDS 291

Their absorption into the blood neutralizes the normal alkalinity of that
fluid, causes contraction of the capillaries and increases the arterial tension
by increasing the force of the heart’s action. They do not to any great extent exercise a direct influence upon the nervous system. The most active
of these acids in this particular is the sulphuric acid. This is prescribed in
the form of the aromatic sulphuric acid and has a slightly tonic and sedative
effect upon the nervous centers.

Their influence in neutralizing the alkalinity of the blood increases the
acid character of the secretions, notably that of the urine.:

Toxicity—Poisoning from these acids occurs from the local destruction
of tissue which takes place so rapidly that but little absorption of the acids
oceurs. Their poisonous influence should be treated by the administration
of alkalies to effect in a chemical manner, their neutralization. It is often a
fatal waste of time to undertake to protect the tissues from their influence
by the administration of oils and other unctuous substances. The introduction of a stomach tube is dangerous because of the ease with which the walls
of the stomach or esophagus are perforated.

Antidotes—In the selection of alkalies to neutralize these acids when
taken in excessive quantities, the carbonates and bicarbonates should be
avoided if possible where the liberation of carbonic acid gas is likely to produce distension or rupture. The free sodium or potassium hydrate in common soap is an active neutralizing agent, and a dilute solution of the soap
may be administered. Liquor potassium, calcined magnesia, lime water or
aqua ammonia, fully diluted, may be administered. The administration of
the carbonates of magnesia, sodium or potassium is of advantage and very
efficacious where the liberation of gas will not produce harm. Treatment
subsequent to the neutralization of the acid consists of the administration
of demulcents with hypodermics of strychnine and brandy, and of morphine
if necessary to relieve severe pain.

Physiological Action in Medicinal Doses—Ringer claims that acids allay
thirst by promoting the secretion of alkaline saliva; that acids before meals
check the secretion of the normal acids of the gastric juice, and that if
given after meals where there is a persistently sour stomach, the acidity will
be increased; that acids stimulate the salivary secretion first by an impression upon the mucous membrane, which is conducted to the spinal cord and
thence reflected through the cerebral and spinal nerves to the salivary
glands, because if these nerves are divided, acids have no influence on the
salivary secretion.

The influence of acids then, in increasing the action of the salivary
glands, greatly lessens the thirst of fever patients and overcomes the extreme dryness of the mouth and mucous membranes. The thirst lessened,
general irritability of the nervous system is soothed. Sleep follows as perspiration appears upon the skin, the temperature is reduced and a general
beneficial result follows.

Specific Symptomatology—In the administration of acids the presence
or absence of these in the system must be fully considered.

The general predominance of an alkaline condition is evidenced by a
red condition of the mucous membranes of the mouth. A thin, narrowpointed, red tongue, with usually a deficiency of the secretions, er a dry,
brown coating on the tongue, or a sleek, red, dry tongue, shows a demand
in the system for acids, and their administration is usually prompt in overcoming a train if symptoms dependent on this condition, and greatly facilitates the action of other indicated remedies. There may be, however, in
some cases, especially in protracted fevers, an excess of acids in the system at large, with deficiency of secretion of hydrochloric acid. This is evi-

denced by extreme anorexia. The tongue is usually moist and the papille
are red at the base, but elongated and tipped with a white coating, through
which the pinkish redness of the base can be seen. In these cases if alkaline
salts given prior to eating do not stimulate a secretion of hydrochloric acid,
that agent must be given regularly for some time, especially after the taking of food.

We have known this condition to persist during neurasthenia where the
redness of the tongue or membranes was not marked, but where the whitetipped papille persisted for months, The food test showed an almost complete absence of hydrochloric acid—achlorhydria—while the urine and other
secretions were acid in reaction.

ACIDUM HYDROCHLORICUM.

Synonym—Hydrochloric Acid.

Description—Free hydrochloric acid is a colorless gas with a pungent
odor and with a sharp, acid, caustic taste. It is irrespirable and destructive
to vegetation. Thirty-one and nine-tenths per cent of this gas dissolved in
water constitute the official hydrochloric acid. The dilute hydrochloric acid
of the pharmacopeia contains only ten per cent of the gas.

Occurrence—The gas is made by the action of sulphuric acid upon the
chloride of sodium. It is a by-product also in the manufacture of sodium
sulphate from common salt. It may be also made from the chloride of magnesium or potassium.

ACIDUM HYDROCHLORICUM DILUTUM.

Synonym—Hydrochloric Acid Dilute.

The strong acid is too concentrated for medicinal purposes, consequently
the dilute acid is alone universally employed in therapeutics. It is made by
combining three ounces of the full strength acid with seven ounces of distilled water. It is preserved in glass stoppered bottles.

A tion—The dose of the dilute acid is from five to thirty
minims well diluted. It should be taken, as all the mineral acids should,
through @ glass tube to prevent its destructive action upon the enamel of
the teeth.

If colic, disordered bowels and vomiting occur from the administration
of acids, it is an evidence that they are contra-indicated.

Therapy—Hydrochloric acid, the free acid of the gastric juice, is essential to digestion. When deficient in the digestive fluids, the evidences of
which have been named, it may be directly supplied. Indigestion due to this
cause is treated by the administration of from five to twenty drops of the
acid in water immediately after eating. Its administration in these cases
every two or three hours is sometimes necessary to complete the digestion
and restore tone to the stomach, stimulating the glands to normal secretion.

When its indications are present it is a most efficient remedy in low
fevers and in typhoid forms of inflammatory fever, and is of much value in
malignant scarlet fever. It is indicated in many cases of phthisis pulmonalis, and in nearly all cases of neurasthenia at some time during the course
of the treatment.

It is an excellent remedy also to counteract phosphaturia and the deposit of phosphatic sediment or calculi in the urine.

ACIDS 298

As in the chronic catarrh of the stomach in alcoholics and in cancer of
the stomach, there is usually absence of hydrochloric acid, in these cases this
acid is demanded.

ACIDUM NITRO-HYDROCHLORICUM.

Synonym—Nitro-hydrochloric Acid.

Occurrence—Nitro-hydrochloric Acid is made by combining six fluid
ounces and forty-one minims of full-strength nitric acid with twenty-seven
ounces, five drams and forty-eight minims of Hydrochloric Acid in a glass
vessel. This forms what was known as the aqua regia of the alchemists and
earlier chemists because of its power to dissolve gold.

Description—This combination forms an intensely corrosive fuming
liquid. It has a golden-yellow color and may be wholly volatilized by heat.
It is unstable and should be kept in small bottles which are only in part filled
and are kept in a dark, cool place.

Administration—For medicinal use it is prepared by adding water at the
time the acids are united, in the proportion of three ounces of nitric and
four ounces of hydrochloric acid and twenty-five ounces of water. It is advisable, however, to unite the acids before the water is added. From five to
twenty minims of this, well diluted, is prescribed for internal use.

Therapy—lIt is somewhat difficult to determine the exact cases in which
this acid is superior to its constituents given singly. It is, however, specific
in cases of functional torpor of the liver and in incipient cirrhosis. It stimulates the flow of the bile in a marked manner. In chronic hepatitis it is
sometimes very valuable. It is contra-indicated where there is obstruction to
the flow of the bile, or catarrh of the gall duct. In these cases its use should
be preceded by such remedies as chionanthus, iris versicolor or leptandrin.
Like its constituents it is beneficial in many forms of dyspepsia from deficient
secretion, both of the glands of the stomach and those of the intestinal canal.
It is also valuable in the oxalic and uric acid diathesis.

ACIDUM NITRICUM.

Synonym—Nitric Acid.

PREPARATIONS—There are at least five varieties of Nitric Acid in commerce and pharmacy.

First—The pure acid, just described, marked C. P. (chemically pure).
It must be kept in strong glass bottles in the dark, the bottles always full, and
stopped with glass stoppers, sealed with paraffine.

Second—The commercial aqua fortis, a yellowish, very impure liquid, too
impure for chemistry or pharmacy, sometimes containing arsenic, iron, sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, and the nitrogen oxides. It is also in two
strengths—the single acid containing 39 per cent of the strong acid, and the
double acid containing 64 per cent.

Third—The Fuming Nitric Acid, highly concentrated, more or less free
from impurities. It is of a reddish-yellow color, and is a powerfal oxidant.

Fourth—The U. 8S. P. Acid. It contains 70 per cent of the C. P. concentrated acid; is a valuable caustic and escharotic.

Fifth—The Dilute U. S. P. Acid. It contains only 10 per cent of the C. P.
acid. The B. P. acid contains 17.44 per cent.

294 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Occurrence—Nitric Acid may be prepared by the action of sulphuric
acid oe the nitrate of sodium or potassium in a glass retort, Na(NO,)-++
H,(S0O,)—=HNa(SO,)-+-H(NO,). The Nitric Acid is driven off by distillation.

Administration—-For internal use the diluted acid only is administered.
It must be given freely diluted and taken through a glass tube or a straw. The
dose is from one to six or eight drops three times daily. Three drops every three
hours is about the usual prescription. As a caustic the full strength C. P. acid
may be used, avoiding the destruction of too much tissue at a single application.

Nitric acid produces on animal tissues a characteristic yellowish discoloration, by which its action may be known.

pecific Symptomatology—When the indications for the action of this
acid are conspicuous, the tongue and mucous membranes are ef a violet, carmine
or clear red color, the membrane being apparently transparent, showing the red
color through or below it. There is marked deficiency of secretion from the
mucous membrane and glandular structures.

Therapy—This agent in medicinal doses is an excellent tonic, antiseptic
and astringent. It stimulates the intestinal glands, modifying their function
and inducing normal activity. Although not naturally present in the intestinal juices, it operates very similarly to hydrochloric acid. If there is diarrhea
with indigestion, this agent is superior. If there is constipation, hydrochloric
acid is preferable.

When indicated, it operates satisfactorily in cases of indigestion if given
after the meal. In some cases of chronic gastric acidity a few drops of dilute
nitric acid given four or five times a day will produce a permanent cure. In
some forms of intestinal indigestion evidenced by pain in the bowels, occurring from one to two hours after eating, this agent is curative.

It may be given in alternation with other digestives or bitter tonics. In
chronic diarrhea of children, with persistent green discoloration of the fecal
matter, especially if alkaline in reaction and of an offensive odor, the agent is
of much service.

In intestinal hemorrhage and bleeding piles, nitric acid has been given
with good results. A lotion of the acid may be applied in the latter case.
Nitric acid given when uric acid is excreted in abnormal quantities, or
where the oxalic acid diathesis is present, will relieve both of these conditions.

Externally both nitric and hydrochloric acids were at one time used
very extensively in baths. They exert a very powerful stimulating influence
upon the function of the skin. This is most marked in the night sweats and
debilitating perspiration following exhausting fevers and accompanying pulmonary tuberculosis.

Nitric acid in full strength applied to chancres and chancroids destroys
at once the specific character of these ulcers. If carefully applied, no harm
to surrounding tissue nor local inflammation is induced, and it is but seldom
that a second application will be needed. It is applicable to phagedenic
ulcers and to gangrene.

ACIDUM SULPHURIOUM.

Synonyms—Hydrogen Sulphate, Sulphuric Acid, Oil of Vitriol.

Dilute Sulphuric Acid of the pharmacopeia contains only 9 or 10 per cent
of the strong acid. This dilute acid—the medicinal Sulphuric Acid—is prepared by combining three and one-half ounces, by weight, of the acid with
thirty-two and one-half ounces of distilled water. The acid is added slowly to

## Page 284

ACIDS 295

the water and not the water to the acid. Extreme heat is evolved by the process
of mixing.

Acidum Sulphuricum Aromaticum.

Synonyms—Aromatic Sulphuric Acid, Elixir of Vitrol.

Administration—The dilute sulphuric acid and the aromatic acid only
are administered internally. The dose of either is from two to twenty drops
well diluted. As an escharotic the C. P. acid is used,

Physiological Action—The physiological action of sulphuric acid in a
general way is described heretofore in the general action of mineral acids. It
neutralizes alkalinity, produces irritation of the mucous membranes and in
extreme cases may produce gastro-intestinal irritation. If this irritation is at
all severe, a congestion of the intestinal glands may result which materially
interferes with the process of nutrition, the patient dying from inanition.
Muscular weakness is one of the results of overdoses of this acid.

Specific Symptomatology—In fevers, a brown-coated tongue of dark
color, with dark mucous membranes; the coat increasing in color in the center to
black; the tongue usually dry, with deep red tip and edges, indicates sulphuric acid.

Therapy—tThe strong acid has been used as a caustic, but is more irritating than nitric acid, which mow replaces it in all conditions in which it was
previously used, with perhaps the single exception of the cauterization of the
bites of rabid animals, in which it seems to be superior to other caustics.

As an antiseptic and stimulant to mucous surfaces it acts similarly to the
sulphurous acid. It is superior, however, in adynamic diarrheas or diarrheas with extreme prostration. It is not only an antiseptic in these cases,
but exercises a positive astringent effect. Used in epidemics of cholera its
apparent influence has been very marked. Many patients taking it in anticipation of the attack have failed to be attacked. A pleasant method of administration in these cases is from four to six drops of the aromatic acid in a glass of
sweetened water, forming an artificial lemonade, which may be drunk at the
pleasure of the patient.

The lemonade above mentioned is a very grateful drink in typhoid or
typhus fever when this condition prevails. In all inflammatory conditions
with these indications, especialiy in inflammation of the vital organs, and in
erysipelas the influence of this acid will often apparently cause a decline of
the fever.

This agent is a reliable hemostatic in passive hemorrhages; where there
is feebleness of the mucous membranes with sluggish capillary circulation
it is excellent. The aromatic acid is much the more active in this particular.
This inherent property renders this agent useful in excessive mucous discharges from whatever locality, being eliminated rapidly from the skin; the
astringent and stimulating influence of the agent is exercised directly in the
control of colliquative night sweats. The tonic properties of the agent making it especially desirable for this purpose in the protecting sweats that follow
all forms of continued fever and the night sweats of pulmonary consumption.

The agent was at one time used for prolapsus ani, piles, fissure of the
anus or rectum, also phagedenic ulcers, aphthous ulceration of the mouth
and salivation, for which we have mentioned the use of the sulphurous acid.

King ascribes nerve tonic properties to this remedy and advises it in
certain forms of nervous prostration, especially where there is irritation of
the spinal cord. In cases where quinine may be used in conjunction, that agent
may be dissolved in this acid and given in an aromatic syrup or elixir.

ACIDUM TARTARICUM.

Synonym—Tartaric Acid.

Therapy—It stimulates the mucous and salivary secretions and is a
somewhat efficient agent in fevers. An artificial lemonade can be made from
this acid by dissolving it in water and adding a few drops of the essence of
lemon. By adding a small quantity of this acid to the bicarbonate of sodium
or potassium, a pleasant effervescent drink is made.

CHAPTER VII.
Agents Used as Assistants to Gastric or Intestinal Digestion—Digestives.

PEPSIN. PAPAW. DIASTASE.
PANCREATIN. INGLUVIN. TAKADIASTASE.
PEPSIN.

Occurrence—Pepsin is the natural enzyme—a proteolytic ferment, obtained from the glandular structure of the lining membranes of the fresh stomach of the domestic hog—sus scrofa. It is an essential constituent of the gastric
juice.

Description—Pepsin occurs in the form of scales, granules or as an
amorphous powder. It is yellowish-white, translucent, has a characteristic odor
and a peculiar, moist, elastic feel to the touch. To the taste it is slightly acid,
bitter, saline. It is soluble in 100 parts of water, but by the addition of hydrochlorie acid its solubility is greatly increased. It is insoluble in alcohol and
chloroform.

It should have a digesting power equal to 3,000 times its own weight of
freshly coagulated egg albumen.

Administration—It is given in the form of the powdered pepsin or as
saccharated pepsin in doses of from three to ten grains. The essence of pepsin
in dram doses is an excellent form for administration.

Physiological Action—Pepsin digests the nitrogenous constituents of
food, converting them into peptones. Its action is increased by the addition of
hydrochlorie, lactic and citric acids.

Therapy—A deficiency of the digestive ferments in the stomach, evidenced in painful or imperfect digestion, is largely supplied by the administration of pepsin. Whenever severe disease induces inactivity of the glandular organs of the body, there is apt to be inefficient action of the peptic
glands, and consequently a deficiency of pepsin. This is the case after
severe shock, either from injury or from surgical operation, in neurasthenia,
and in brain or spinal disease; also in severe acute inflammatory disease, in
protracted fevers, in heart disease, in diabetes, and especially in gastric
ulcers and cancer. In all these cases, there being atonicity with enfeeblement of functional operation, pepsin in conjunction with tonics, stomachics
and hydrochloric acid is often demanded.

Infants fed on artificial food are benefited by the use of pepsin. It may
be be given during or at the end of the meal, and is often productive of excellent

re here malnutrition is marked, and the growth and development of the
child retarded from this cause, this agent is sometimes the means of accomplishing a complete cure. In diarrhea in childhood from indigestion, a most

AGENTS FOR GASTRIC AND INTESTINAL DIGESTION 297

important factor in the treatment, is the perfect digestion of the food. A little
skill on the part of the physician can often so adjust the administration of pepsin as to satisfactorily accomplish all desired results in such cases, often without the use of astringents. Mild intestinal antiseptics are eften necessary in
conjunction.

It is argued that artificial digestion, by doing the work of the gastric juice,
is apt to produce impairment of the function of the gastric glands because of
inactivity or non-use. It is the observation of those who have used pepsin,
pancreatin and papoid, that they act not only as assistants to the digestive processes, but that they stimulate the gastric glands, and impart real tone and
renewed functional energy. This may be in part due to the immediate improvement in general nutrition from the rapid appropriation of the more perfectly
digested food. These digestives exercise a sedative influence also upon the
poe when there is nausea and irritation due to the presence of undigested

The partial predigestion or peptonizing of the food of infants suffering
from malnutrition is generally recognized as an essential process. This
process is adopted with invalids suffering from gastric disorder, and is advised also in preparing milk for administration per rectum, when no food
can be introduced into the stomach. In this case a few grains of pepsin
added to the prepared enema, whatever its character, is of great assistance
in its appropriation.

Pepsin in solution has been used to dissolve the false membrane in croup,
and the exudate in diphtheria. It has also been injected into the urinary bladder to dissolve blood-clots, and applied to indolent ulcers to destroy unhealthy
tissue and stimulate the surface to normal granulation.

PANOREATIN.

Occurrence—Pancreatin is found in the fresh pancreas of warm-blooded
animals, and is obtained for general use from the pancreas of the hog.

ConstTITUENTS—Pancreatin is a mixture of several enzymes, consisting of
the ferment trypsin, similar to that of pepsin, proteolytic in character, but
active in an alkaline medium; a starch digesting ferment—amylopsin resembling diastase or ptyalin; a milk digesting ferment, and a fat emulsifying
ferment—stearopsin, closely allied to that found in the bile.

A solution of pancreatin is prepared, called Liquor Pancreaticus. The
fresh pancreas is finely minced and exhausted with water, strained and treated
with dilute alcohol for preservation. This is often more active than the powder.

Description—Pancreatin is a grayish or yellowish amorphous powder,
with a characteristic odor and taste, soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol and
chloroform.

Administration—It is most active in an alkaline medium, is destroyed
in a strongly acid medium, and is consequently best given from two to three
hours after eating, when it assists the intestinal digestion. Dose, from two to
twenty grains.

Physiological Action—It will peptonize various articles of food, such as
milk, oysters, broths and gruel, and will emulsify oils and fatty foods intended
for rapid nutrition.

Specific Symptomatology—Pain in the intestinal canal, beginning an
hour or more after eating, and continuing for two or three hours; eructations of
fatty foods; passage of undigested fats with the feces, are all indications for
the use of pancreatin.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 287

298 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Without these indications it may be given in the slow convalescence of
wasting disease, where anorexia and malnutrition are present and not corrected
by pepsin and stomach tonics.

Therapy—The agent is of some use in gastric inactivity, but in the stomach, there is but little influence it may exercise that is not fully exercised by
pepsin.

However, if administered at the beginning of a meal, it will sometimes
exercise a full beneficial influence before enough of the gastric acids are
poured out to retard its action—an influence sometimes more satisfactory
than that exercised by pepsin, but as the acidity of the stomach fluids is apt
to retard or destroy its influence, it is best given an hour or more after meals
if there is impairment of the intestinal digestion, where it acts td the best
advantage. If the stomach digestion is nearly complete, a dose of magnesium
or. ‘pea carbonate or bicarbonate may be given to neutralize any excess of
acid.

It will accomplish desirable results in lienteric diarrhea, and in the diarrheas of infants where there is marked emaciation, the stools containing fat
cells in abundance.

Pancreatin, the liquor pancreaticus, or the powdered pancreatic glands

of cases.

PAPAYA.. CARICA PAPAYA.

Synonyms—Papaw, Pawpaw, Melon-tree.

Part Employed—<An active principle obtained from the juice of the unripe fruit.

ConstiITvENTs—The active principle has been variously named papain
papaotin, papoid or caroid. It is precipitated by alcohol, is a nitrogenous
principle approximating in character a true albuminoid, and is associated with
vegetable peptones and a milk-curdling ferment.

Description and Administration—It is a powder of cream-white color,
almost odorless and with but little taste. It is easily soluble in water and aleo
in glycerine. Dose, from one to three grains. A larger dose may be given where
immediate effects are desired, but is seldom necessary. It is sometimes advisable
to repeat the dose in from one to two hours.

The natives have long had a custom of wrapping fresh meat in the leaves
of the pawpaw, claiming that it prevented decomposition, softening it and
materially assisting its digestion. They also applied the juice to open and
offensive wounds, to cleanse them and promote healing.

Therapy—The indications for the use of papoid in treating digestive disorders may be summarized somewhat as follows:

Actual and relative deficiency of the gastric juice or its constituents. (a)
Diminished secretion of gastric juice as a whole; apepsia, anemia and deficient
blood supply; wasting diseases. (b) Diminished proportion of pepsin; atonic
dyspepsia; atrophy of gastric tubules. (c) Diminution of hydrochloric acid—
achlorhydria; carcinoma. (d) Relative deficiency of gastric juice; overfeeding.

In gastric catarrh. (a) Where there is tenacious mucus to be removed,
thus enabling the food to come in contact with the mucous membrane. (b)
Where there is impaired digestion.

In excessive secretion of acid, to prevent duodenal dyspepsia.

In gastralgia, irritable stomach, nausea or vomiting.

AGENTS FOR GASTRIC AND INTESTINAL DIGESTION 299

In intestinal disorders. (a) In constipation due to indigestion; in diarrhea,
as a sedative. (b) In intestinal worms. (This claim the writer has not personally verified, but as the intestinal mucus which shields the worms is removed by
papoid, it is easily understood that their destruction would naturally result, or
would be more readily accomplished after its administration.) Hutchinson
treated tapeworm successfully with five grains of the dried juice twice daily.

In infectious disorders of the intestinal tract. (a) Where there is abnormal
fermentation, by its antiseptic action, which may be heightened by combination.
(b) Where there are foreign substances present, its detergent effect may be
utilized in clearing these out from the intestinal canal by their digestion.

In infantile indigestion. Here papoid not only readily peptonizes cow’s
milk, but the resulting curds are also rendered soft and flocculent, resembling
those of breast milk.

In case of obstruction of the esophagus by the impaction of a piece of meat.
or gristle, a paste of papoid and water produces softening in a short time.

Nearly all of the above statements have been confirmed in the experience
of the writer durmg ten or twelve years’ constant use of the agent, alternated
with, but seldom in conjunction with the animal ferment.

Where papoid or any form of pawpaw is used as a digestive agent, there
may be observed an increase in the amount of uric acid when that substance
is deficient, and if oxalates are present they are diminished.

It is a reliable remedy for general distress or pain in the stomach and
bowels during the process of digestion. It can be prescribed almost without
discrimination in these cases, and the results are in some cases surprising. It
may be given during the meal, and pain not occur for an hour. At that time,
its influence being probably spent, another dose will continue the effects of the
first. Its effects become permanent usually in acute or subacute cases after a
few days, when it may be discontinued.

It is not a remedy for pain occurring before meals or after the food is

digested, or for gastric pain occurring without regard to the taking of food
—continuous pain and distress—since these pains are either neuralgic or
organic in character. The agent is specifically one for functional disorder.
It is a most valuable agent in catarrh of the stomach and in the digestive
failure accompanying continued fevers. It stimulates the stomach in the beginning of convalescence, and in some cases increases the appetite and promotes absorption of the digested pabulum.
+ It is serviceable in the digestive disorders of pregnancy, stimulating appropriation and assimilation. In those cases where the digestion is seriously
interfered with during the last three months of pregnancy, it being almost impossible, because of the great pain induced, for the patient to take any food
into the stomach, the condition will be entirely relieved by this agent within a
few days, the patient being enabled to eat large meals of meat without discomfort and with satisfaction.

The agent is a solvent of fibrin, and has been used to dissolve false membranes, old hardened tissue, warts and tumors, and has been satisfactorily
applied to epithelioma.

Mortimer Granville reports several cases of cancer of the stomach
treated very satisfactorily with this agent. In diphtheria the powder serves
a@ most useful purpose in dissolving and permitting the removal of the densest
exudate, which in some cases covers the pharynx and naso-pharynx, and occludes
the nares. Good results have been reported by Jacobi, Hubert and others, and
have come under our own observation. Kots and Asche are reported in the
Prescription as having observed more than a hundred cases treated with success
by this method.

Empirically it has been used in a few cases of nephritic colic with the
most marked results. It will diminish the formation of the oxalates, although in cases where tried there has been an increase in uric acid.

INGLUVIN.

Occurrence—Ingluvin is the active principle derived from the gizzard
of the domestic fowl—ventriculus eallosus gallinaceus. The lining structure of
the chicken’s gizzard is a dense, hardened membrane, surrounded by powerful
muscles. The motion of these muscles upon the contents of the gizzard is accompanied by the continuous exudation of a strong, organic fluid from glands located
in the lining membrane. This fluid acts preliminarily upon the food before it
reaches the gastric juices in the stomach, and also assists in the complete digestion of the food when there. It exercises in part the function of pepsin, as well
as of the ptyalin of the salivary secretion.

Description—The substance occurs in scales or as a coarse granular
powder, yellowish or brownish-yellow in color. It is bitter, slightly acid, and
has but little odor. Dose, from three to twenty grains.

Therapy—The digestive powers of this agent are not as wide as those
of pepsin, but it is efficient in cases where there is indigestion with nausea
and gastric irritation. Pain in the stomach, with the above conditions, is relieved by this agent. In the deficient action of the stomach accompanied
with nausea and vertigo in neurasthenics this is a useful remedy, as it certainly acts as a tonic or stimulant, increasing the functional activity of the
stomach and soothing both local and reflex irritation. It is of much value
in the vomiting of infants from local or undetermined causes. In these cases
thirty grains may be stirred into half of a glass of water and a teaspoonful
of this given every ten, twenty or thirty minutes. In small infants equal
parts of Ingluvin and bismuth may be stirred together in the water and administered in smaller doses. It is given in capsules when large doses are
needed in adults. This combination is of much efficacy in cholera infantum
and in other protracted diarrheas with nausea. Sodium bicarbonate should
be added where there is excessive acidity.

In the vomiting of pregnancy it has won its highest reputation and
should be given in doses of from five to twenty grains before meals. It may be
given in two ten-grain doses, one before and the other at the end of the meal,
when the nausea is accompanied with indigestion. If the nausea is constantly
present it may be given at any time at short, regular intervals, but with best
results when the stomach is empty. In these cases when there is excessive nervous irritation with hysterical phenomena, an active nerve sedative will greatly
facilitate the action of this remedy. Dilatation or mild cauterization of the
os uteri may remove one of the causes of nausea, the Ingluvin afterwards
quickly soothing the stomach.

When given as a digestive it should be given during or after the meals.
The agent certainly exercises an influence which differs widely from that of
pepsin and pancreatin, and yet is fully as important and valuable.

DIASTASE. TAKADIASTASE.

Diastase is one of the principles of the digestive fluids of the animal
body. It appears during the fermentation of starchy substances—grains. It
is one of the enzymes capable of being classed with pepsin and pancreatin of


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 292

AGENTS FOR GASTRIC AND INTESTINAL DIGESTION 301

the digestive group. Its especial function is the conversion of the starch molecule into a sugar molecule.

iastase is a form of diastase which results from the growth, development, and nutrition of a distinct microscopic fungus known as the eurotium
oryxe.

Administration—Two grains of Takadiastase is the usual dose, although
five grains is often given. The dose is usually given in a capsule during or
at the end of the meal. In liquid form one dram contains two grains.

Physiological Action and Therapy—aAs stated the agent possesses a diastatic and fermentative property. Its specific field is the correction of diastatic imperfections. It converts 100 times its weight of dry starch into
sugar. It digests starches and prevents constipation, flatulence, malaise, insomnia, headache and vertigo, which result from the ptomaines of undigested
and decomposed starch.

While starch digestion is its direct field of action, it is found of much benefit
in apepsia—in incomplete digestion from atonicity. It is found to be a most
useful remedy, and yet so recently has it been given to the profession, that
complete observation cannot be said to have been made. It is believed that a
much wider influence will yet be found to be exercised by it than has yet
been observed.

Note—Other well known assistants to digestion are hydrochloric acid,
described in another chapter, the malt extracts, lactopeptine and peptenzyme.
The two latter preparations are proprietary, and the writer has no perfect
knowledge of their composition, although they have served him a good purpose at times. Those described are in common use.

Agents Acting upon the Intestinal Glandular Organs and upon the Intestinal
Canal.

CHAPTERI.
Laxatives and Cathartics

CASCARA. ALOES. OLIVE OIL.
RHEUM. SENNA. PARAFFIN OIL.
CASTOR OIL.

CASCARA SAGRADA.

Synonyms—Rhamnus Purshiana, chittem bark, sacred bark, Bearberry,
bear-wood.

Const1TUENTS—There are present a crystalline, bitter principle and three
distinct resinoid bodies, not bitter, which are believed to be derived from chrysophanic acid which is thought to be present in the bark.

PREPARATIONS—Fluid Extract Cascara Sagrada, not miscible with water.
Dose, as a stomachic tonic and function restorer, three to ten minims; laxative,
five to twenty minims four times a day; as a cathartic, twenty to sixty minims morning and evening.

Solid Extract Cascara Sagrada. Dose, as a laxative, one-half to two grains;
as a cathartic, three to eight grains.

Powdered Extract Cascara Sagrada, produced by evaporating the solid
extract at a low temperature and triturated with sugar of milk, same strength
as the solid extract.

Cascara Cordial with elimination of the bitter principle. Dose, half a
dram to a dram and a half.

ological Action—Dr. Bundy, the discoverer of cascara, writing in
1878, says: “‘I employ a fluid extract of cascara, using one ounce in a four
ounce mixture in combination with other remedies or alone, as the case may
require. It acts upon the sympathetic nervous system, especially upon the solar
plexus, stimulating the nutritive and assimilative forces, increasing the digestive processes generally. It acts upon the secretory system in a marvelous manner, especially where the secretions are deficient and perverted, and this seems
be one of its special indications. Constipation depends upon the nature of the
diet, deficiency or a faulty composition of the intestinal secretions, disordered
glands that pour their secretions into the intestines, impairment of muscular
power, which leads to a deficiency in their propelling power which may result
from nervous or mechanical influences, congestion of the portal circulation,
normal secretion of intestinal juices interfered with, deficiency in biliary secretions of a healthy character, congestion of mucous membranes of intestines, and
last and the most frequent, constipation which has been caused by resisting the
calls of nature from carelessness or circumstances that prevent obedience at the
proper time.’’

Scheltzeff in 1885 (London Med. Record) made the following observations:
“In doses from four to ten cubic centimetres (with double quantity of water),
cascara sagrada excites the secretion of gastric juice and increases it during


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 294

LAXATIVES AND CATHARTICS 308

digestion. It increases also the secretion of the pancreatic juice. It excites and
increases the secretion of bile. It has no action on the secretion of saliva. It
has not led to any rapid and considerable evacuations.’’

Caseara is a bitter tonic of specific value in its direct influence upon the
function of the stomach and intestinal canal. It acts upon the vasomotor system, stimulating the glandular apparatus of the intestinal tract to more perfect
secretion, and increasing peristaltic action. It is especially indicated in torpidity or atonicity, quickly restoring functional activity.

It is not a cathartic in the common acceptation of the term, but by restoring normal function, by its tonic influence, bowel movement of a natural
character follows.

It does not mechanically liquefy and empty the intestinal canal, but it
restores normal elasticity and tone to the relaxed structures, and natural vermicular motion and persistaltic action, exercising a direct influence upon
muscular structure of the intestinal walls. It materially influences the
venous and capillary circulation of the entire intestinal tract, thus proving
of much value in hemorrhoids.

Administration—In prescribing cascara for the cure of chronic constipation, large doses at the first are undesirable. In a single dose, so large as
to produce a cathartic effect be administered, subsequent small doses will prove
insufficient to restore tone, and the constipation will remain unless the large
dose is constantly repeated. If a dose of from two to ten drops in a proper
vehicle be given, three, four or five times daily for many days, even if the constipation does not at first yield, the effects after a few days are usually salutary.
There is a normal movement in the morning and the habit of regular evacuation
can be soon fixed, and as the agent is continued the dose may be slowly decreased
until a single drop at each dose is given. Finally, a single small dose morning
and night may be continued for a time and then stopped, the bowels continuing their normal action.

If constipation pre-exists, it is well to give a simple laxative or to flush
the bowels thoroughly with some other agent before beginning the use of this,
to overcome the chronic condition. The results can be sooner obtained also by
smaller doses.

Therapy—Large doses of the agent produce colic and are seldom needed.
In the temporary constipation of pregnancy or in the convalescence of acute
disease, doses of from one-fourth to one-half dram in a tonic mixture, preferably
of malt extract, taken at the bed hour will be most satisfactory. Often a single dose followed by a glass of cold water on rising will have a salutary effect.
This is true of constipation extending over a short period, not necessarily
chronic. To produce an immediate effect as a physic, a dram of the fluid extract
should be given, and it will probably induce some pain. The agent should
not be used in this active form for its immediate effects during the pregnant
term, as its irritating influence may be sufficient to produce miscarriage.

Cascara in medium doses is an efficient agent in gastric or intestinal
catarrh. It quickly restores the normal tone of the mucous membranes, suspending undue secretion and acting in perfect harmony with other measures
adopted.

It is a useful remedy in many cases of chronic indigestion and in chronic
disease of the liver. It has been used in cirrhosis with the best of results. It
is useful in jaundice with deficient excretion of bile, and corrects catarrh of
the bile duct. It is useful in diarrhea, subacute or chronic, depending on
deficient liver action, and upon catarrhal and atonic conditions of the intestinal tract.

In 1886 quite an interest was excited by the assertion of Goodwin, of
New York, that cascara was an excellent remedy for rheumatism. Many ex-

perimented with it and some reported excellent results, but its use for
this purpose has not been continued. It is, however, of value in the treatment of those cases where gastric and intestinal disorders are present, given
in conjunction with more specific agents.

RHEUM. RHEUM OFFIOCINALE.

Synonyms—Rhubarb, Chinese or Turkey Rhubarb.

ConstITuENTs—Chrysophan, pheoretin, erythrorrhetin, aporetin, chrysophanic acid, rheotannic acid, emodin, gallic acid, rheumic acid, calcium oxalate,
sugar, starch, salts.

PReparaTions—Extractum Rhei, Extract of Rhubarb. Dose, from ten to
fifteen grains.
Extractum Rhei Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Rhubarb. Dose, from a half
to two drams.

Syrupus Rhei et Potasse Compositus, Compound Syrup of Rhubarb and
Potassa, Neutralizing Cordial. Dose, from one to four drams.

Specific Medicine Rheum. Dose, from one to twenty minims.

Physiological Action—The influence of this agent is peculiar. It is a
laxative first, cathartic if in extreme doses, and subsequently astringent. It
tones the gastro-intestinal tract to a marked degree, if debilitated, and if
over-activity is present, the agent restrains that condition.

It mildly and satisfactorily evacuates the bowels without irritation or stimulation. Some individuals eat a few grains of the crude root, which they carry
in the pocket, every day for chronic constipation, others are not benefited with
large doses.

Therapy—tIn atonic conditions of the bowels, with debility or general
relaxation, whether diarrhea, dysentery, cholera morbus or cholera infantum
is present, it is a most useful remedy. Its tonic powers are promptly exercised,
and properly combined with indicated remedies, it produces markedly restorative effects. It acts directly upon the duodenum, and subsequently upon the
entire intestinal tract. It is the laxative for debilitated patients, or for patients recovering from prostrating disease.

Given to a nursing mother, like aloes, it relaxes the infant’s bowels, and
in some cases it is desirable to administer it to the mother for this purpose.

SYRUPUS RHEI ET POTASSAE COMPOSITUS.

K na ons —Syrup of Rhubarb and Potassa Compound. Neutralizing
0.

This old Eclectic formula has attained such a wide notoriety—is in such
general use in our own school, and is now so popular among the regular physicians and so generally adopted by them, that it deserves a conspicuous place
in this book. It has no superior as a restorative to acute abnormal conditions
of the stomach or bowels demanding an antacid. Prof. King’s original formula is as follows, which happily combines the active virtues of its constituents. Suggestiuns and alterations for its improvement have not in all
its factors produced a better compound.

Formula—Best India Rhubarb, Golden Seal, Cinnamon, each one ounce;
Refined Sugar, four pounds; Brandy, one gallon; Oil of Peppermint, twenty. Macerate the Rhubarb, Golden Seal and Cinnamon, in half a gallon
of the Brandy for six hours, with a gentle heat, then transfer the mass to a

percolator and displace with the remaining half-gallon of Brandy. The remaining strength, if there be any, can be obtained by adding water until the
liquor comes off tasteless, To this add one ounce of Carbonate of Potassa,
the Sugar and Oil of Peppermint, this last having been previously rubbed
with enough Sugar to absorb it, and mix the two liquors. The whole of the
active properties of the ingredients may be obtained with more certainty by
using Alcohol, seventy-six per cent, instead of Brandy, owing to the great
want of uniformity in the quality of the latter.

Because of the possibility of the fermentation of the sugar in the above
compound, Professor Lloyd has replaced this and enough of the water necessary to the above solution, with glycerine, preserving the valuable properties of the compound and increasing the field of its action. This preparation
is called Glyconda, and is given for the same conditions, and in the same
dosage as the above.

Administration—The syrup is given in doses of from half a dram to half
an ounce, usually diluted with considerable water.

Therapy—While we advocate the use of single remedies for direct
effects, we have obtained such marked results from this combination that we
are impelled to teach students its use, especially in children’s gastric disorders. A sour stomach is always benefited by it. It is specific when the
tongue is coated uniformly white, and is broad, and the mucous membranes
are pale, when there are eructations of sour gas or vomitings of acid matter.
It never fails in these cases. It makes no difference whether there is diarrhea or constipation.

A stomach filled with sour decomposed food can appropriate no medicine,
and all specific remedies demand a stomach free from these conditions. This
agent neutralizes excessive acidity without liberation of carbonic acid gas; it
stimulates and soothes the stomach and promotes normal action. It may be
given to neutralize excessive acidity before general medication is begun in any
case.
It is the remedy for children’s summer disorders par excellence. It is
a safe remedy to use ad libitum in the family for deranged conditions of the
stomach and bowels.

A tablespoonful, taken by an adult in summer when nausea, colic or
diarrhea declare a derangement of the organs of digestion, will usually immediately restore the normal condition. It is palatable and pleasant to children, especially if diluted. In fevers or headaches from gastric acidity the
treatment should be begun with this syrup, the indicated remedies being
given when excessive gastric acidity is in part neutralized and the normal
condition stimulated by the rhubarb. It may be added to the vehicle in
prescriptions for stomach and bowel troubles of an atonic character.

If constipation be present a mild laxative may be added. If much
diarrhea is present an astringent, such as geranium or epilobium will increase its value, and if there is extreme lack of tone, its value is enhanced
by the tincture of xanthoxylum or capsicum. If there are sharp colicky pains,
a few drops of the tincture of colocynth or the tincture of ginger, or even
paregoric, or deodorized opium in severe cases, will be found valuable. It
should be in constant use by every physician in stomach and intestinal disorders common during the heated term.

ALOES. ALOES SOCOTRINA.

Synonym—aAloe Perryi.
ConstITUENTS—Aloin, resin, volatile oil.

Aloinum, Aloin. This is a crystalline substance obtained from Aloes, of a
yellowish-brown color; odorless and with the taste of Aloes. It is twice as active
as Aloes and produces less griping. Dose, from two to five grains.

Physiological Action—It is not rapid or so severe in its action as some
other cathartics, Given at bedtime it operates upon rising in the morning.
The action is not painful, and it increases the alvine discharges without any
increase of the watery constituents. It increases the circulation of the blood
in the intestine, improves the muscular tone and restores normal peristaltic

Aloes acts most freely on the lower bowel. It increases the activity of
the muscular coat of the intestines, increasing peristalsis, especially of the
colon. It causes soft dark colored feces. It is not to be used when there are
hemorrhoids, or when there is irritation or inflammation of the colon, or pelvic organs, nor should it be freely used in pregnancy.

It increases the secretion of the liver, pancreas, and intestinal glands;
also the mucous glands of the intestines. It causes some griping when given
as a laxative, but belladonna, colocynth, or hyoscyamus will correct this colic.

Specific Symptomatology—Homeopathic indications for this remedy are
headache across the forehead and over the eyes, nausea, gastro-intestinal irritation with coldness of the lower limbs; there is a bitter, sour or metallic
taste in the mouth, the tongue yellowish white, somewhat dry, with thirst;
bitter or sour eructations; heaviness over the liver; pulsation in the navel region; distention of the abdomen with gas with the above conditions.
Gloomy patients suffering from constipation can take aloes to advantage.

Therapy—If administered to a nursing mother it will produce a cathartic effect upon the infant. It is a constituent of the larger proportion of the
carthartic pills on the market.

If the liver is acting normally a much less dose will produce a cathartic
effect than when there is a torpid or an inactive liver.

The agent should be used, if at all, with much care in inflammatory conditions, especially in those of the intestinal canal, as it is an irritant to the
lower bowel. It increases the heart’s action and the circulation of blood and
raises the temperature.

The agent is emmenagogue and abortive in its action and should not be
given during pregnancy. It will produce a full menstrual flux in some cases
of suppression.

It may be given in simple jaundice with lack of tone; in constipation depending upon weakness of the intestinal tract; where there is plainly deficient peristaltic action, where the tongue is coated, the breath foul, the abdomen full and tumid; where there is inclination to impaction of the colon.
It may be given in conjunction with nux vomica and hydrastis, or other good
stomach tonics to excellent advantage when these are correctly indicated.

One one hundred and twentieth grain of aloin once every day or two will
be of material benefit to those who eat too much, especially of starchy foods and
sugar; those of phlegmatic temperament and beer drinkers.

Pulvis Jalape Compositus, Compound Powder of Jalap. (A. D.) Beach’s
Antibilious Physic. Dose, one dram.

Specific Medicine Senna. Dose, from one to thirty minims.

Therapy—Senna is an efficient remedy, mild, kindly, certain and uniform in its action. It is a constituent of the larger number of the proprietary
laxative or cathartic compounds, syrups, cordials or elixirs.

It is used in all cases of temporary constipation, however induced. An
infusion of the leaves is not unpalatable and is promptly active. It produces
normal evacuations of the bowels and if used carefully there is but little griping.
It is used after surgical operations, after confinement, in the constipation of
the feeble, and in many cases of inactive bowels among infants and children. It
is not used where a powerful derivative is needed, or where active cholagogue or
hydragogue influence is demanded. It has a narrow but important sphere.

Co-Operatives—In combination with ginger, capsicum or black pepper
it is useful in atonic conditions with inactivity of the bowels. With magnesium sulphate, or potassium bitartrate, it will induce more of a hydragogue
effect. In combination with leptandra it acts more specifically upon the liver;
with jalap and ginger it was long known as antibilious physic and was given
whenever ‘‘biliousness’’ was diagnosed; with rhubarb and peppermint it is
a tonic, laxative and carminative of greatly improved value. It is the active
constituent of the well known and popular, Compound liquorice powder.

The composition of this powder is as follows: Senna and liquorice in fine
powder, of each two ounces; fennel fruit, sublimed sulphur, of each one otnce;
refined sugar, six ounces. Mix thoroughly. Dose, from one-fourth to one dram
in water.

The following is an excellent simple laxative:

A strong infusion of senna leaves is made and strained. In the clear liquid
good French prunes are stewed until thoroughly cooked. One of these three
or four times daily will overcome many cases of constipation, especially when
the tendency is only temporary, or due perhaps to other conditions, temporary
in their character, as during tedious convalescence. Especially useful in pregnancy.:

Figs and senna leaves, chopped together finely, have been long in use
for laxative purposes..

RICINUS. RICINUS COMMUNIS.

Synonym—Castor Oil.

Part Employed—aA fixed oil from the beans of the Ricinus Communis.

ConstitveNts—The fixed oil, ricinoleic or ricinic acid, ricinolein, palmitin,
starch, mucilage, sugar.

PREPARATION—In the preparation of castor oil the seeds are crushed, kilndried, and subjected to a powerful pressure to remove the oil, which is heated
in water to remove albuminous matters and drawn off into barrels.

Cold-pressed castor oil, Oleum Ricini, is viscid, nearly or quite transparent, with a mawkish odor and an offensive taste. Dose, from one to eight
dra:

Administration—The taste of castor oil is disgusting to many and unpalatable to all. It is partially disguised when the dose is added to a teacupful

of hot milk and well stirred. Hot lemonade or hot coffee disguises its taste to
a certain extent. Wine, ale and beer are suggested, probably because of a love
for such auxiliaries.

erapy—aAs a cathartic in domestic practice this agent has long taken
first rank. Children are susceptible to its action. An inunction of the oil
over the abdomen is usually sufficient to produce a full laxative effect in
babes. It may be continued from day to day for the cure of chronic constipation in young children. A kneading or rubbing of the bowels will stimulate peristaltic action and increase the influence of the oil.

When nervous irritation in children occurs with fever, from undigested
food or irritating substances in the stomach or bowels, a dose of castor oil
sufficient to produce free evacuation without pain may be given at once. Its
action will usually remove the irritating causes, and the fever and nerve irritation will quickly subside. Diarrheas induced from such causes are at once
controlled after its operation. It has a secondary action like rhubarb, and
constipation usually follows its use for a day or two.

In the treatment of dysentery it is good practice to thoroughly evacuate
the bowels with castor oil and to follow it with full doses of sweet oil. In infants
the sweet oil alone may be sufficient. If the oil is administered early in the case
and followed with the suggested remedies the disease often abates at once.

It seems in itself to exercise a mild sedative effect, not only that it quiets
distress in the bowels and removes irritating substances, but it promotes quiet
and sleep.

It is used in a few cases after surgical operations, after labor on the
second or third day, and after taking vermifuges, and whenever a simple,
prompt agent is needed to evacuate the prime vie.

OLIVE. OLEA EUROPGA.

Part Employed—A fixed oil from the pericarp.

Therapy—Olive oil or sweet oil is a nutritive and laxative for children.
It must be given in doses of one or two tablespoonfuls. It can be flavored
and rendered palatable. It may be given whenever irritating substances are
retained in the intestinal tract, and when convulsions are present from gastro-intestinal irritation. It can do no harm. Violent and profound convulsions with acute enteritis, from swallowing the seeds of grapes, have been
controlled at once by the writer, with large doses of sweet oil internally,
and by using rectal injections of the oil very warm, large quantities of the
seeds being removed and the local irritation soothed.

It is now generally used internally and externally in the treatment of
appendicitis, and it is a most efficacious remedy. It is given freely internally
at regular intervals, and after its external application heat is kept constantly
applied. Indicated remedies for the fever and for the prominent symptoms
should not be overlooked.

It is of much value in the removal of biliary calculi. In these cases
from six to twelve ounces is the necessary quantity for administration, repeated
three or four times daily. The influence is often pronounced.

It is an excellent agent in dysentery, whether of infants or adults. It
may be given per orem, and a quantity subsequently injected into the rectum
after a bowel movement. If for an adult, two ounces, into which ten drops of
laudanum has been rubbed, is injected, often the distress is so relieved that it

or where there are ulcers or fissures and great pain is induced by the presence of fecal matter in the rectum.

A feeble, newly born infant may be quickly bathed in warm sweet oil and
wrapped in cotton, and surrounded by heat and not dressed for several days.
The oil can be wiped off once daily with a soft linen cloth and fresh warm oil
applied. In healthy infants it is better to apply warm oil freely, wipe it off
once and apply more. The child should then be wrapped in warm wrappings
and not dressed for twenty-four hours.

Olive oil is the best of lubricants, and the carbolized oil is used for chafing
and upon hands and instruments in surgery, and in vaginal examinations, and
in introducing bougies or catheters. If a stream of warm oil be forced into the
urethra in spasmodic stricture just in advance of the catheter, the dilation may
be made satisfactorily, and the catheter may be introduced when that act was
previously impossible.

Olive oil is exceedingly valuable in the treatment of sprained, bruised or
contused parts, applied warm on absorbent cotton and kept hot. It acts as nutrition to the part, diffuses the heat and is markedly soothing in its influence.

Olive oil is used to protect the mucous surfaces of the esophagus and stomach when poisoning has occurred from the caustic alkalies. It also forms a neutral innocuous soap with the alkali and can subsequently be removed. With
acids it is of no service. In some cases a fatal loss of time occurs from depending upon this, when magnesia or lime water or soda or a soap solution should
have been introduced to neutralize the acid.

PARAFFIN OIL.

This substance is now prepared from the mineral oils by a number of manufacturers and is quite commonly used.

It is given in doses of from a teaspoonful to two tablespoonfuls. It is
devoid of taste or odor, and therefore not unpleasant to take. It is plainly an
oil though of about the consistency of glycerine. This oily character is an
objection to some.

This agent has been brought before the profession within the last few years
as an important remedy in the treatment of intestinal disorders. It is not a
laxative in the strict sense of the word.

The remedy has been useful further in simple stasis as well as in constipation of infancy and childhood. It is useful in hemorrhoids, and in mucus
coltis, and during pregnancy. As stated, its place has not yet been determined; neither have all the objections been stated nor all the contraindications. These must be looked for.

Its entire influence is topical. It is used in the words of an English
writer for the all essential indication for the constant sanitation and sanitary toilet of the bowel. If given in conjunction with small doses of castor
oil, a laxative influence is sustained with this cleansing agent. It is claimed
that it systematically and completely prevents septic culture in the ileum, leaving the bowel and stomach in a much healthier condition for the exercise of the
alimentary function. It prevents the common occurrence of ulceration in the
ileum and colon.

It prevents septic fecal retention, inducing a thorough cleansing throughout the course of any disease. The agent may be given in divided doses any
time when a mild laxative influence is desired, but a tendency to constipation
as stated, must be overcome at the same time with more active agents.

310 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

The use of the agent has been carried to extremes, and this will militate
against determining its actual function. It contains no stimulant or irritating
properties; it exercises no osmotic action. It is simply a lubricant, which supplements normal mucus and assists peristaltic action. Very little if any of it
is absorbed. It removes irritation from hardened feces, and restores normal
mucus. It facilitates evacuation and assists in re-establishing a habit of regular
bribe movement. It covers fecal masses and prevents absorption of toxins from

IRIS. BOLETUS. MERCURY.
CHIONANTHUS. BOLDUS. SODIUM PHOSPHATE.

Note—There is hardly a group of remedies among all that we have
studied, that exercise a more important influence or exercise that influence in a
more satisfactory manner, than those of the organic group named in this
chapter if prescribed by one who is thoroughly conversant with their influence, and able to prescribe them accurately. They should be persistently
studied and the conditions to which they are applicable should be determined with great care.

PODOPHYLLUM. PODOPHYLLUM PELTATUM.

Synonym—Mandrake.

ConstTITUENTS—Picropodophyllin, picropodophyllic acid, podophylloquercetin, gum, starch, gallic acid, volatile oil, fixed oil, salts:

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Podophylli Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Podophyllum. Dose, from five to ten grains.

Resina Podophylli, Resin of Podophyllum, Podophyllin. Dose, oneeighth grain.

Specific Medicine Podophyllum. Dose, from one-fourth to ten minims.

This exclusively Eclectic remedy has occupied a prominent place in our
literature for eighty-five years. John King isolated Podophyllin as a resinoid in 1833, and published a report of his method and observations on the
remedy in 1844 in the Philosophical Medical Journal of New York. Following
King’s suggestions, Lewis made an analysis of the drug in 1847 which was
first quoted by the U. S. Dispensatory in 1854, twenty-one years after King had
first isolated the resinoid. It was called by the Eclectics of that time vegetable
calomel because it was used to replace calomel in their therapeutics.

In malarial country regions this agent will be more often indicated than in
the city, as the habits and environment of city life are more apt to induce extremely opposite conditions to those which indicate Podophyllin.

Administration—The physiological action does not suggest to a great
degree the uses which our experience has taught us to make of this remedy.
The drastic cathartic influence we do not necd, as it is too harsh in its active
influence. From five to thirty drops of the tincture in a four ounce mixture,
or from one two hundredths to the one-twentieth grain of podophyllin, will
be found sufficiently active.

AGENTS ACTING AS LIVER STIMULANTS 311

Specific Symptomatology—This agent is demanded in inactive conditions
_of the gastro-intestinal tract, indicated by a heavily coated tongue, which is
thick, broad and pale, and the coat of dirty yellow color especially at the base,
together with perhaps vertigo, complete anorexia, and dull heavy headache. The
circulation is full and sluggish, and the abdominal viscera is in a plethoric
condition.

Therapy—These conditions will suggest the use of the agent whatever
the name of the existing disease. In acute inflammatory conditions, or in irritable conditions of the stomach or bowels, it is contra-indicated in active doses.

In the condition known as biliousness, with markedly inactive liver, sallow skin and conjunctiva, constipation, highly colored urine containing uric
acid, urates in great excess, and bile, it is of value. In these cases the following
formula, although unpleasant to the taste, will be of great service:

Tincture of podophyllum, tincture of leptandra, of each half a dram; tincture of capsicum twenty minims; syrup of liquorice, half an ounce; port wine
sufficient to make four ounces. Give a teaspoonful every two or three hours.

If there is enlargement of the liver, with general indisposition, soreness
over the liver and pain through the right side and under the right scapula, it is
the remedy..

In inactivity of the liver characterized by constipation, the feces when
passed being solid or hard and of a grayish or clay color, and floating upon
water, with general indisposition, podophyllin may be given in doses of onefiftieth of a grain every two or three hours. If there is a great sluggishness
with obstinate constipation, one-tenth of a grain may be given for two or
three doses, the smaller doses to follow. It is given in jaundice with its
marked indications to excellent advantage. If given for its cathartic influence it should be combined with hyoscyamus or belladonna, or it may be
given in conjunction with leptandra virginica.

Podophyllin, in from one-half to one grain doses repeated once or twice,
and followed by half a pint of pure olive oil, is reasonably sure treatment in
the removal of gall stones. The results may be painful, but the patient will
have subsequent relief.

The agent in minute doses will permanently cure some conditions which
cause chronic constipation, but if desired for this purpose, like cascara, it
must at no time be given in full active doses. Locke advises a teaspoonful of
a mixture of thirty grains of the second decimal trituration in a half glass of
‘water to be given a child three times each day for constipation.

In minute doses it will stimulate intestinal secretion and peristaltic action in children, and overcome dry stools, and constipation and bloated
bowels, with erratic colicy pains.

In the treatment of hemorrhoids accompanied with constipation from
deficient peristalsis and general abdominal plethora, podophyllum is of direct
service. It can be given ‘in conjunction with collinsonia and the effects are
marked from the first.

The writer has prescribed the tincture or fluid extract of podophyllum
for several years as an alterative. If the plethoric conditions named as indicating it are present, it is much more active, and is always to be given in
doses sufficiently small to avoid any irritating or cathartic effects. In skin
diseases of childhood, such as cracked and fissured conditions of the skin of
the face, or eczema, or persistent pustular conditions, it is of value.

It may be prescribed with most happy results with other alteratives in
scrofula or syphilis, or in the eruptions which result from these disorders.

Younkin is authority for the use of this agent in one-sixth of a grain
doses, with ten grains of the potassium bitartrate, given every two hours in

gonorrheal epididymitis, of which it relieves the pains and abridges the inflammation. Other indicated remedies are, however, not to be overlooked.
It may be given with confidence in this condition.

LEPTANDRA. LEPTANDRA VIRGINICA.

Synonyms—Veronica Virginica, Linne; Culver’s Root.

ConstiTUENTS—Leptandrin, resin, saponin, tannin, mannite, gum, citric
acid, volatile oil.

PREPARATIONS—Resin of Leptandra, Leptandrin. Dose, from one-fourth to
one grain.

Extractum Leptandre Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Leptandra. Dose, from
twenty to sixty minims.

Specific Medicine Leptandra. Dose, from one to twenty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—Malaise from malarial influence, soreness on
pressure in the right hypochondrium, with wide dullness on percussion,
constipation, full abdominal tissues with inactive intestinal glands, torpor of
the liver, anorexia, dull headache. Also in cases in which there are marked
vertigo, cold extremities and cool skin, dull pain in the bowels, gloominess
or mental despondency and depression, disinclination to work or even move,
great lassitude.

Therapy—In malarial conditions no cathartic is more efficient than
leptandra. It may be given in full doses, and there is no irritation from its
action. It certainly increases the discharge of bile and stimulates and
greatly improves the function of the liver.

In ague when quinine is given as an antiperodic, if from one-fourth to
one grain of leptandra be given with each dose in the intermission, the effects
are much more marked and the influence is more permanent. It is demanded
in malarial fevers of all kinds, and especially in remittent fever. It is given
alone at the onset of the attack as a laxative and in the remission, in small
doses in conjunction with the antiperiodic, proving a most valuable auxiliary
to the treatment. As an addition to vegetable tonics when malarial conditions
prevail, it improves the tone of the entire gastro-intestinal canal and increases
the functional activity of the glandular organs. In some cases small doses in
wine will produce excellent results.

In the treatment of jaundice it is a valuable auxiliary, and combined
with the tonics here indicated its influence is most desirable. It clears the
skin, produces black alvine evacuation, and assists in overcoming the entire
train of symptoms.

Leptandra has no superior in a case of this character and must be used
freely to be appreciated. It is certainly under-estimated.

IRIS.. IRIS VERSICOLOR.

Synonym—Blue Flag.

ConstTITUENTS—Acrid resinous matter, tannin, gum, starch.

PREPARATIONS—Oleoresina Iridis, Oleoresin of Iris. Dose, one to five
grains. Extractum Iridis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Iris. Dose, five to sixty
minims. Specific Medicine Iris. Dose, one-fourth to five minims.

Physiological Action—Iris Versicolor has a bitter, nauseous, and rather
acrid taste, and in full doses is apt to cause emesis. Recent experiments have
demonstrated that preparations of the fresh root or the oleo-resin possess
active, purgative and diuretic qualities, and under its influence there are in-

AGENTS ACTING AS LIVER STIMULANTS 318
creased secretion and elimination of bile, its cholagogue powers having been
abundantly demonstrated. It also directly stimulates the entire glandular
system—the lymphatics and the skin.

It promotes waste and elimination of effete material from the blood.

Specific Symptomatology—This agent will prove serviceable when the
stools are clay-colored, the urine scanty and the skin inactive and jaundiced.
In small doses it is indicated in irritable conditions of the mucous membranes
of the digestive tract, with altered secretion. This condition is characterized by
a neuralgie pain over one eye, or involving one side of the face, usually the right
side; nausea or vomiting of an acid liquid, with burning and distress in the
esophagus or stomach; gastralgia and gastrodynia, with vomiting or regurgitation of food, especially after the eating of fats or rich pastry; diarrhea, with
a burning sensation after the passage; cholera morbus, with violent pain
around the umbilicus, or in the lower part of the abdomen, and watery diarrhea
with great depression.

Therapy—tThe oleo-resin has been very successfully employed in hepatic
and intestinal disorders, and the consequent dropsy. Chronic jaundice, arising from duodenal catarrh and obstruction of the biliary ducts, should be
treated with Iris. It is said that malarial jaundice (so-called) may be cured
by this drug alone, and that it exerts a favorable influence in bilious remittent fevers and chronic ague. This agent is directly indicated in that condition of the stomach which induces sick headache. It not only ameliorates
the attack, but assists in the removal of the cause and in breaking up the
tendency to recurrence of the condition.

This agent is employed in the treatment of syphilitic and strumous affections. In the treatment of syphilis this agent is a very useful remedy in those
cases in which the glandular organs are inactive. Here the effects of Iris are
strikingly conspicuous from the first. It will be found an excellent auxiliary
also to the influence of other well known alteratives. It has also been largely
employed in the successful treatment of many affections of the skin. Kinnett
recommends it strongly in psoriasis.

In the treatment of certain cases of eczema of a persistent chronic character, as well as of other pustular and open ulcerating or oozing skin diseases,
this agent, in from five to ten drop doses every two or three hours, will be
found most useful. It may be diluted and applied externally also. Prurigo,
crustalactea and tinea yield readily to its influence at times.

It is a favorite remedy in the treatment of enlargement of the thyroid
and other glandular affections. In recent cases of geiter, iris is used to good
advantage. With many, if used in the form of a recent preparation, it is
believed to be specific.

Dr. H. P. Whitford gave iris and hyoscyamus with a very small dose of
podophyllin for headaches in the back part of the head.

Dr. Laws reports the use of iris in a bad case of eczema where the
attacks lasted six months, each worse than the previous one. The disease
would begin at the ankle, finally cover the entire body. The itching was intolerable. He used the remedy both internally and externally with excellent
results. Dr. Kinnett confirms these statements.

Both have great confidence in it in the treatment of goiter, and in the
treatment of syphilis where they do not expect to have to use the iodides
with it. They push it to a mild cathartic effect so that it will keep the bowels
free..

CHIONANTHUS. CHIONANTHUS VIRGINICA.

Synonym—Fringe Tree.

ConstITvENTs—Chionanthin, saponin.

PREPARATION—Specific Medicine Chionanthus. Dose, ten to twenty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—The specific influence of the agent is exerted
upon the liver. It is a remedy for hepatic engorgement; jaundice more or less
pronounced; pain over the region of the gall bladder; pain in the epigastrium;
pain radiating from the navel over the abdomen; soreness in the region of the
liver, extending to the umbilicus; enlargement of the liver, determined by percussion; nausea; occasional vomiting; constipation with dry feces; temperature
slightly above normal; skin usually yellow. This latter indication—a distinctly
yellow skin—has always been my immediate suggestion for chionanthus and I
have rarely been disappointed.

Therapy—It is a cholagogue cathartic in full doses, but its best influence
is in acute congestion of the liver with imperfect discharge of bile, or catarrh
of the common bile duct. We have no agent more certain in its action when
indicated. The indications are acute jaundice evidenced by yellowness of the
conjunctiva first, subsequently of the skin, with distress in the right hypochondrium, with cramp-like pains in the abdomen.

It overcomes catarrh, liquefies the bile, prevents the formation of calculi,
and promotes the discharge of those formed. It is a remedy for chronic forms
of liver disease, but its influence is not so plainly apparent, being much slower
in its operations. It is not indicated in jaundice from permanent occlusion of
the duct, from impacted gall stones or foreign and malignant growths.

ilious headaches resulting from liver faults especially if irregular or
periodical are cured by chionanthus.

The action of chionanthus in the treatment of tobacco habit must be
studied. It has an influence in many cases.

It will quickly overcome the jaundice of childhood and infancy, and especially sure in the jaundice of the pregnant term. It is an excellent remedy
for malarial conditions with atonicity of the stomach and intestinal apparatus. It can be given during the chill and fever, and it assists greatly in the
relief of both. The agent may be pushed to the maximum dose and given with
full confidence when indicated, as it is absolutely certain in its action. It is
sometimes best given in infusion.

Dr. Fearn claimed to have early made the discovery of the use of chionanthus in reducing the quantity of sugar in the urine. Patients with no
appetite, losing flesh, listless, increasingly anemic with a little sugar in the
urine were those to whom he first gave it, ten drops four times a day. Later
he used it in severe cases of diabetes mellitus. Dr. A. P. Hauss, of New Albany, Ind., has had many years’ experience in the observation of this remedy
in the treatment of this disease. He has much confidence in it.

Dr. Halbert of Nashville confirms this influence.

Probably in those cases in which this remedy is beneficial in diabetes there
is functional disease of the liver.

Whether the remedy would be equally beneficial in cases in which no liver
fault could be diagnosed, might be questionable, and yet Hauss says that
he has never treated a case of diabetes mellitus along the lines indicated that
has not yielded to this treatment. He prescribes from ten to fifteen drop doses
of chionanthus, four times daily. If no febrile condition is present or if there is
general atonicity, with nervous depression, he adds from one-half to one drop of
nux vomica. He has the patient drink from one to two pints of hot water each
morning, before breakfast, to which he adds a small teaspoonful of the sulphate
of magnesium, or in preference one-half wine glass of French Lick Pluto water

in a pint of hot water. This treatment, with proper dietary, he claims, has a
rapid effect upon the glycosuria, immediately reducing the specific gravity of
e urine.

The agent is beneficial in chronic splenitis, pancreatic disease and disease
of the other glandular organs; also in the incipient stages of nephritis, In the
line of its symptomatology, it is an exceedingly satisfactory remedy. It influences the stomach in the process of digestion; it exerts a beneficial, stimulating
effect upon the entire glandular apparatus.

Prof. Ralph Morrill gives the following as important in the application
of this remedy: In the obstruction of the bile ducts, due to inflammation
of the duodenum, this remedy is directly indicated. He gives it as an intestinal antiseptic in typhoid fever. He believes its influence is exercised by
its stimulating effect upon the flow of the bile. He has had clinical evidence
of its undoubted value in many difficulties of the gastro-intestinal tract,
which are cured by this important influence. He combines it in some cases
of gastro-intestinal atony, with nux vomica and podophyllum, in the following prescription: Nux vomica, fifteen drops; chionanthus, two and a half
drams; podophyllum, one and a half drams; elixir of lactated pepsin, suffi-
—. quantity to make four ounces. Of this give one dram three times a

ay.
In perverted functional action of the liver, resulting in the excretion of
an abnormal quantity of uric acid, which interferes with the evolution of
proper metabolism present in the formation of urea, and its products, it is a
valuable remedy. It is thus of much importance in the treatment of acute
ep aad from excess of urea or uric acid, and the rheumatic diaesis,

CHELIDONIUM. CHELIDONIUM MAJUS.

Synonyms—Great Celandine, Garden Celandine, Tetterwort.

ConstITUENTS—A bitter principle, and the alkaloids chelidonine, sanguinarine, protopine and chelerythrine. It also contains chelidonic and chelidoninie acids and chlorophyll.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Chelidonium; Extract of Chelidonium; Extractum Chelidonium fluidum, expressed juice of Chelidonium; succus Chelidonium. Dose, ten to twenty drops. Specific Medicine Chelidonium. Dose,
from one-tenth to ten minims.

Physiological Action—Drastic cathartic and violent local irritant, alterative, diuretic, diaphoretic and expectorant.

This agent stimulates the chylopoietic system, favorably influencing all
of those organs which are supplied by the solar plexus of the great sympathetic.

Specific Symptomatology—The conditions to which chelidonium are
especially applicable are found in fully developed abdominal plethora, inefficient functional action of the glandular organs of the abdominal cavity, and
imperfect, sluggish and deficient circulation of the tissues, glands and organs
of this cavity.

This agent operates in harmony: with leptandra, podophyllum, iris versicolor, chionanthus and sodium phosphate, in the three following important
conditions: Diminished secretion of bile, evidenced by grayish, clay-colored,
or very light yellow stools, which will usually float. There may be no evidences of absorption of bile into the blood—no jaundice; or there may be
absorption of the bile and jaundice, with its whole train of symptoms, with
dark green and fetid stools and colic; or there may be the above grayish,

## Page 307

316 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

elay-colored stools and jaundice, with bile in the urine, which is dark yellow
or red, very acid, charged with an excess of uric acid crystals.

Therapy—Sluggishness of the portal circulation. Defective liver circulation, is the cause of a long train of remote manifestations, among which are
slow pulse, frequent palpitations, a feeling of weight, stiffness and swellings
of the hands, feet and limbs, cold extremities, pallid and doughy skin, local
and general, edema, dull pain or constant aching in the limbs and muscles,
aching in the front head and occiput, vertigo, weariness, irritability, inactivity,
irregularity of the bowels—constipation, followed by diarrhcea, erratic colicky
pains, sallowness, jaundice and other disorders. Chelidonium is an excellent remedy in a case with these manifestations.

In disease of the spleen, it relieves congestion and reduces splenic
hypertrophy, acting in harmony with chionanthus and grindelia squarrosa.
Its action upon the pancreatic glands is satisfactory, relieving congestion and
engorgement and irritation, and inducing a better circulation. It will be
found an excellent remedy in combination with helonias in the treatment of
diabetes mellitus.

This agent was used thirty years ago with eminent success in the treatment of biliary calculi. It is now in use for that purpose among many phyicians, who consider it superior to any other agent known in preventing their
formation.

Its influence upon the functional activity of the liver induces a thinner
and more profuse secretion of the bile, and it is thus useful in promoting the
expulsion of gall stones. It is available also in simple biliousness, hepatic
congestion, acute or sub-acute inflammation of the liver, jaundice, due to
catarrhal conditions of the ducts, or when dropsy depends upon hepatic
trouble. When migraine or supraorbital neuralgia depend upon hepatic difficulties this remedy is indicated.

A patient suffering from a headache’ which began in the occiput before
rising in the morning; poor appetite; cold hands and feet; tongue large,
thick, pasty, with a grayish white coat; skin of a dusky hue, was materially
benefited by chelidonium, five drops of the fluid extract every two hours.

Some of the old writers believe that this agent is superior to arnica or
hamamelis, as an external application to bruises and sprains. It prevents the
development of local inflammation from traumatic causes.

The specific use externally, is in the application of the juice to warts,
corns and epitheliomata, for which it has been widely used, and much evidence accumulated in its favor. In these conditions and in the treatment
also of urticaria, eczema and itching eruptions, its careful application, persisted in, cures within a short time.

In the treatment of cancer, Denissenko directs that from twenty-two to
seventy-five grains of the extract shall be taken internally, dissolved in distilled water or peppermint water, every day throughout the treatment. Into
the substance of the tumor, as close as possible to the boundary between it
and the healthy tissue, he throws a number of injections of from two to four
drops of a mixture of equal weights of the extract, glycerine and distilled
water, not exceeding a syringeful in all. If the tumor is ulcerated, he paints
its surface twice a day with a mixture of one or two parts of the extract and
one part of glycerine. The painting of the ulcerated surfaces gives rise to
a light and transitory burning. In all instances, after the injections, especially after the first one, there was a burning pain at the site of the operation, the patient felt weak, there was a more or less severe chill, and then
the temperature rose to between 100 and 102 degrees. These symptoms disappeared on the following day.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 308

AGENTS ACTING AS LIVER STIMULANTS 317

As a result of the treatment the sallow hue of the skin disappeared and
softening of the tumor set in. After from three to five days there formed at
the points of injection, fistulous tracts about which the softening process
went on with special rapidity. Other investigators have not been as satisfied with its influence in cancers, but it is doubtless of value and deserves
further observation. Iron, quinine and other supporting remedies are employed according to the indications.

POPULUS. POPULUS TREMULOIDES.

Synonyms—American poplar, White poplar, Quaking aspen.

ConsTITUENTS—The important constituents are populin and salicin, a
resin and essential oil. The buds contain an acid resin.

PreparaTions—Powdered bark. Dose, one dram two or three times a
day. Saturated tincture of the bark, from one-half to twenty drops. Populin, one-tenth of a grain.

Therapy—The older writers were enthusiastic concerning the tonic and
antiperiodic properties of this drug. They claimed that it would replace
quinine in the treatment of intermittency. It has never come into general
use. A recent writer says that he soon learned that a strong infusion of the
bark would cure those forms of intermittent fever, of a chronic or irregular
character. At the same time the pathological lesions of the liver, spleen and
kidneys which accompanied the chronic disorder, would gradually disappear
with the ultimate complete restoration of their physiological functions.
These results were accomplished without the unpleasant effects that occur
after the protracted use of quinine. This writer, passing through an epidemic
of severe malarial disease, found that malarial hematuria was very common
and very hard to cure. He put his patients upon the infusion of cottonwood
bark, and found the symptoms to yield rapidly, not only the hemorrhage, but
the icterus, and other conditions depending upon disarrangement of the liver
and stomach. He found that results obtained by this remedy were more permanent than those obtained by the use of quinine in some cases.

Protracted fevers, with debility and emaciation, are greatly benefited
by the use of this remedy, and the conditions remaining in early convalescence are quickly overcome. The agent is a tonic to the kidneys, increasing
their functional activity, relieving vesical and urethral tenesmus. It will
also overcome prostatic hypertrophy in some cases, and is available in uterine congestion. It is of service in impaired digestion, either gastric or intestinal, chronic diarrhea, with general debility. Other specific remedies
may here be given in conjunction with it. Dr. Alter says that it corrects
errors of physiological metabolism, induced by malarial toxemia. It is a
most powerful antiperiodic. It will not cause deafness. It will not cause
abortion, but on the contrary will prevent abortion, which is threatened by
the presence of malarial conditions. It shows its inflence best where there
is general debility, very marked, with impairment of the nutritive functions
of the body.

Dr. Fearn says, concerning populus, this remedy is a powerful stimulant,
tonic, and diuretic. And this statement fixes its place in treatment, in the
hands of the true specific medicationist. When we use this remedy as a
tonic or diuretic, we should never use it in cases accompanied with irritation whether it be of the stomach, bowels, uterus, bladder, or prostate. In
atonic conditions of all these different organs where we desire to stimulate
and tone up the organ, populus is a grand remedy. When first I began to
use this Sampson among remedies of its class, I had to use decoctions of the

bark—it was a nasty, bitter dose. How much better to use the specific medicine in from five to twenty drop doses.

Dr. Howe reported a case where a soldier had chronic diarrhea which
may have been caused by malaria. Howe put him on populus for a time and
made a complete cure. If a little of the poplar bark be put into a cup and
covered with boiling water, this will make a strong enough infusion for
many conditions, taking only a teaspoonful or two at a time.

Dr. Alter of Arkansas has given it for many years for swamp fever. He
also uses it in the irregularities of women. He thinks it acts somewhat as
hydrastis in promoting a physiological action of all organs, and increasing
the vital force within the system. It may be well given in conjunction with
hydrastis. Dr. Alter used it very widely whether it was strictly indicated
or not, and became convinced of its active therapeutic property.

BOLETUS. BOLETUS LARICIS.

Synonyms—White Agaric (Agaricus Albus), Larch Agaric, Purging
Agaric, Fungus Agaric, Spunk.

ConstTiTvents—There is found an excess of resin, agaric acid, agaricol,
cholesterin, and agaricin.

PREPARATIONS—The tincture, dose from one to five drops. Agaracin,
from one-sixteenth to one-fourth of a grain. Specific Boletus, from onefourth of a drop to five drops.

Specific Symptomatology—Chilliness at regular intervals, followed by
marked fever. Alternate chills and flushes of heat, with severe aching in the
back, colliquative sweats, night sweats of phthisis.

The: erapy—The remedy is applicable to all conditions of malarial o
It is especially useful in those localities where malaria and the results of
malaria prevail, The symptoms are langour, dullness, and general malaise,
long continued, with the usual results, such as disordered digestion, lack of
appetite, heavily coated tongue, pale mucous membranes. Usually there is
a bitter taste in the mouth, often persistent, with constipation, and a dull,
persistent headache. The temperature will be quite erratic. In some cases
there is a little fever always present. In others, there is a marked intermission. The intermission, or remission, may be irregular, not only in time,
but in amount.

The agent is astringent apparently, and overcomes all excessive secretion. The broncho-pulmonary secretion of incipient phthisis, or the night
sweats of the protracted cases, are benefited by this reuedy. It also controls the rapid circulation and seems to exercise a favorable influence over
the hectic fever. It also favorably influences the diarrhea of this disease.
It geems to allay the thirst and control the cough with many of these

It will arrest the flow of milk, in the nursing woman, and will correct
in many cases the tendency to passive hemorrhages. Some claim that it
will check arterial hemorrhage, making the application of a ligature unnecessary.

and the observations have been made from its influence, it is doubtful if it
is superior to the specific boletus if the latter remedy is given in proper
doses, and persisted in.. Fly Agaric.

This agent is closely allied to the above in its physical characteristics.
Scudder advised its use, but it has never been generally adopted.

Physiological Action—From this species a common alkaloid has been
obtained, Muscarine, which has been used an an antagonist to atropine. It
produces ptyalism, vomiting, depression of the circulation, general muscular
weakness, paralysis, difficult breathing, followed by death in extreme cases.
The pupils contract to a pin point, and subsequently dilate. It produces
tetanic contraction of the spleen, bladder and intestines, with violent peristaltic movement.

Therapy—Muscarine is used in the night sweats of phthisis, in a manner similar to the agaricin. Also in diabetes insipidus. Scudder gave as
specific indications for the fly agaric, involuntary twitchings of the face,
forehead and eyes, pressing pain in the occiput, with a lack of muscular
control. It seems indicated in the typhoid conditions where there is tremor
and great restlessness, with a desire to get out of bed.

BOLDUS.. PEUMUS BOLDUS.

Synonyms—Boldo. Boldu (Boldoa Fragrans, Gay).

ConstTITUENTS—The plant contains an essential oil, a volatile oil, and an
alkaloid, boldine. A narcotic alkaloid called boldoglucin.

PREPARATIONS—A tincture is prepared. Dose, five to twenty drops.
Boldine is given in doses of from one to five grains. The essential oil is given
in capsules in three to five drops. Fluid extract, from ten to thirty minims.

Physiological Action—Dr. Holmes, from Florida, has written a very excellent article for the National Medical Association, in which he says the
agent, in its influence upon the liver and kidneys, relieves toxemia, or autoinfection, which has resulted from retention of the bile. It favors the resumption of functional activity of the liver, when stagnant, without increasing the peristalic action of the bowels, as most liver remedies do. thus acting kindly upon the general intestinal canal. At the same time, it increases
the functional power of the kidneys, so that their influence in carrying off
morbific material, the products of retrograde metamorphosis, greatly facilitates the progress of recovery.

Therapy—The agent has not been in general use. The physicians of the
south extol its virtues in the treatment of liver diseases. It is of excellent
service in the treatment of chronic intestinal trouble where there is congestion and general inactivity of the liver. Present with this condition there
may be painful digestion resulting from gastric debility, where there is also
anemia with a general sallowness of the skin.

In the first case in which Dr. Holmes used the remedy, there was pain
and tenderness over the right hypocondriac region. The skin was yellow,
urine scanty, dark colored, almost coffee-ground color, the pain extended
into the epigastric region. The tongue was heavily coated in the center, the
tip and edges red, the pulse was between ninety and a hundred, and temperature 100. The patient dull, sleepy, indisposed to exercise, and the pain
resembled that of gall stone. Pain, nausea and vomiting were present.

Chionanthus, chelodonium, iris, podophyllum, leptandra, euonymus, were
all used and failed. The symptoms increased till the patient had a pulse of

one hundred and thirty and a temperature of one hundred and five, and was
reduced to a skeleton. At the suggestion of a man from Chile, S, A., he
gave this remedy in sixty-drop doses of the fluid extract, every four hours.
The effect of the remedy was immediate, and the cure perfect.

The doctor reports four or five other cases where these symptoms were
present with some variation, all cured by this remedy promptly, after our
usual specifics had failed. The agent certainly demands careful investigation.

GRINDELIA SQUARROSA.

Grindelia squarrosa is closely allied to the grindelia robusta, but is in
general a less leafy and bushy plant, and is smaller. Some authors are not
satisfied that there is sufficient difference between them to make them distinct plants. In the West they are not recognized as the same.

Therapy—Dr. Webster is authority for the statement that grindelia
squarrosa is specific in its anti-malarial properties. He is very positive concerning its influence upon headaches, and especially those of malarial origin.
Headache present where there are masked intermittent symptoms, headache
accompanied with dizziness, and some nausea, where the subject walks with
the sensation that he is going to stagger. It seems as though his equilibrium were uncertain, or where there is mild staggering and irregular gait,
where the head feels light and dizzy all the time. In this form, grindelia
squarrosa is a positive and specific remedy, decided and satisfactory in its

Another form of headache which this agent will cure is one that seems
to follow, and depend upon slow autointoxication. It is persistent, day
after day, and there is dullness, drowsiness, and dizziness. There is apt to
be torpor of the liver and spleen in these cases. There is lassitude, and the
patient tires easily. A dull headache is present when he awakes in the
morning, and with some exacerabations continues all day. This form is
quickly cured with this remedy. A tincture made by covering the fresh
plant with ninety-eight per cent alcohol is required to relieve this headache.
Give from ten to fifteen drops of this tineture every two or three hours.

As a remedy for chronic enlargement of the spleen, and for the symptoms present in that condition, Webster claims that the agent is superior to
polymnia. Where there are persistent attacks of malaria, and where the
system needs a permanent tonic, this agent is of great importance. It promotes the appetite, increases the functional activity of both the liver and
spleen, in a normal and very satisfactory manner, and in longstanding cases,
the periodicity of all the symptoms, whether of the fever or chill, is overcome by this remedy in a manner superior either to quinine or arsenic. The
remedy is best obtained from low, swampy, marshy ground. That which
is found in Colusa County, Cal., where Dr. Bundy collected his specimens,
is found to be the best.

MAGNOLIA. MAGNOLIA GLAUCA.

Synonyms—Beaver Tree, Sweet Magnolia, ‘White Bay, Swamp Sassafras, White or Red Laurel.

PREPARATIONS—The powdered bark. Dose, from one-half to one dram,
five a six times a day. Infusion, wine-glassful. Tincture from one-half to
two drams.

conditions, ‘but restores the tone of the gastro-intestinal tract, which has been
lost through the persistence of prostrating fevers, or active malarial conditions. In chronic rheumatism, accompanied with prostration, and loss of

OccurrENcE—This is composed of mercury, powdered licorice, marshmallow and glycerine. Dose, from one-fourth of a grain to five grains.

Physiological Action—Notwithstanding the very general use of Mercury for more than two centuries, its action is not yet clearly defined and
its use is entirely empirical. It is classed as a universal stimulant, and has
been used perhaps in every known disease. All authorities now admit that
it has been a greatly over-used remedy.

Taken into the system in the milder forms it produces fetid breath,
spongy gums and tender, ‘‘sore’’ teeth. The gums bleed readily and the flow
of saliva is greatly increased, finally to an inordinate quantity. The inhalation of the vapor of mercury produces the above symptoms rapidly and in a
marked manner. These are conspicuous in workers with the metal in the
arts in which it is employed. It affects all the special senses in a marked
and serious manner; the teeth loosen and drop out, the patient becomes
feeble, debilitated, with general, physical and mental weakness; the corpuscular elements of the blood are destroyed, this fluid becoming greatly
impoverished. The bones, especially the maxillaries, are subject to necrosis,
and there is a general disintegration of tissue.

There are muscular trembling, paralysis agitans, chorea, and in some
cases locomotor ataxia. The bichloride of mercury—corrosive sublimate—is
violently poisonous and produces the most violent gastro-intestinal irritation,
vomiting and purging of mucus and blood with the intestinal contents, collapse, with all of its phenomena and death.

In the consideration of mercury, and its compounds as therapeutic
agents, the Eclectic school has in the past taken a unique position. The
promiscuous, unscientific and excessive use of the agent in the latter part
of the last and the early part of the present century, for any and every condition, with the dire results that occurred from such indiscriminate use,
caused our earlier investigators to assume a position at the opposite extreme,
and to declare that its deleterious influences greatly overbalanced any possible good that could result from its use and they decided to exclude tt entirely from the list of medical agents, a course adopted in the matter of
venesection. With this complete ostracism, they at once set about seeking
for vegetable and other remedies to take the place of these agents, and so well
have they succeeded that many of our physicians, eminently successful in
practice, have never given a dose of mercury in any form or never opened,
a vein.

We have so thoroughly replaced mercury in the treatment of syphilis,
that we expect even in the ‘‘saturated’’ cases to remove every trace of the
disease in a year, and in cases taken at the onset, we expect only mild mani-

AGENTS ACTING AS LIVER STIMULANTS 323

festations if any at all. In the experience of fifty years, in the practice of
nearly ten thousand active vigilant practitioners, these results are constantly
confirmed, and ninety-five per cent of our physicians do not know from
cases developed in their own practice, as the fully developed cases have been
brought under their observation, what the developing characteristics of bad
cases are. Our physicians know but little of the constitutional effects of mereury, and have had opportunities of treating mercurial conditions, only as
the deeply seated cases have come to them for treatment, and not as the results of their own use of the agent. The advantages of our method of treatment are that the patient quickly regains his full tone, is not kept from
business, and usually after three or four months’ treatment, he is with difficulty persuaded to continue the treatment, as he considers himself cured.

In its influence as a liver stimulant and as a cholagogue cathartic, mercury is now superseded to a great extent in all schools by agents more easily
managed, and of more rapid and perfect elimination. For no condition is
it given in such excessive doses, and by far the larger part of the profession
who use it, use it in minute or fractional doses.

The antiseptic properties of the bi-chloride of mercury are generally
acknowledged, and this agent as a germ destroyer is in constant use in surIn the treatment of intestinal disorders and as a liver remedy, mercury
with us in almost entirely replaced by such agents as podophyllum, leptandra virginica, iris versicolor, chelidonium and sodium phosphate. In the
treatment of syphilis our most potent remedy is echinacea. The other well
known vegetable alteratives are used in various combinations with iodide of
potassium Other specific conditions appearing during the course of the disease aré promptly met with specific remedies.

Therapy—tin a systematic consideration of the conditions under which
mercury is now used in medicine, they are found to be capable of division
into three classes: First, the use of the agent as a purgative and liver stimulant. Second, its use in the treatment of syphilis. Third, its use as an antiseptic and germicide. A fourth class has been considered, that of an antiphlogistic, but this influence is exercised by virtue of its antiseptic properties.

If the inflammation abates and the temperature falls after its use in
typhoid fever and in diphtheria, it is because of the destruction of the bacillus
in each case. This statement, however, is open to question in its application
to all inflammatory conditions.

In the treatment of inactivity of the liver, and of the intestinal glands
and intestinal obstructions, calomel has been long in use. In the past, calomel
and blue mass were given in large doses for these conditions, but their use
is now superseded by milder agents and is discouraged by almost the entire
profession. Large doses of these agents were given, and then the bowel was
cleared with large doses of salts or other alkaline purgatives. One of the
most pernicious uses of these agents, which is still countenanced in certain
localities, is their use in the forming stage of typhoid to produce violent
evacuation of the bowels, the avowed object being to clear the canal of
disease germs. The theory is fallacious in the extreme, and the results have
been most serious in many cases which the writer has observed. In cases
where so used the fever is apt to run from five to seven weeks. In such cases
an absolutely non-irritating laxative only should be used which should be
followed by a thorough colonic flushing by an antiseptic solution. The
bichloride in dilute solution can be used to good advantage, but one of peroxide of hydrogen is preferable and devoid of danger. The internal use of
the one-sixtieth of a grain of the corrosive chloride afterwards three or four

times daily will keep up the effects, but the peroxide or a vegetable antiseptic, will as effectually preserve asepis with no danger.

In the treatment of syphilis, this agent or its salts are considered by the
old school to be specific. It is a matter of surprise that so much confidence is
placed in it, to the exclusion of all other measures, when every writer narrates so long a train of dire results occurring from even its careful use. The
time advised for its continuance is from two to five years, and measures are
usually suggested for the treatment of its untoward effects, and for the treatment of the extreme debility in which the patient is left. A method entirely
devoid of untoward effects, and completely successful in six months, in the
worst cases in one year, that increases the vital tone of the patient from the
first and leaves him in vigorous health, is much preferable and will ultimately receive general adoption.

In the treatment of syphilis blue mass and calomel are given internally;
but the agent most popular, and used most persistently is probably the protiodide of mercury. The bichloride is advised in this disease hypodermically,
in doses of one-twelfth to one-sixth of a grain.

Inunctions of mercury are made use of in all sanitariums and very generally in private practice. These are made of the oleate or the common ointment, and are applied in the axilla, or in the groins or over the abdomen.

Fumigations or inhalations of the vapor of calomel are also administered
is the treatment of syphilis, a method that has been received with more or less
general favor, but which must be used with caution.

Inhalations of the vapor of mercury are administered in the treatment
of membranous croup and diphtheria, and if any internal use of the agent be
considered rational, this method certainly could be so considered.

As antiseptics the bichloride and the bin-iodide of mercury are in common use. The argument of quickness of action and thoroughness is applicable
to both, but the bichloride is in most common use. The strength of the solutions
vary from one part in one thousand of water to one part in five thousand. Of
the bin-iodide one part in four thousand to one part in twenty thousand of
water is sufficient. The latter has the virtues of the former, and is less liable to
produce poisonous effects because of the large quantity of water used.

The bichloride of mercury is less used as an antiseptic in surgical cases,
than formerly.

It is considered a potent germicide in those cases in which it canbe safely
used. It will coagulate albumen and form with that substance inert compounds. The addition of a small quantity of a sodium chloride solution to the
mercuric chloride solution will prevent such a decomposition. It is most commonly used upon the skin, to render it aseptic in preparation for surgical operation. It is used in the strength of one part to five hundred where a small surface only is to be dressed or where it is to be applied to the unbroken skin;
where extensive use is to be made on open surfaces, from one part in five thousand, to one part in two thousand of water may be used. In some cases it will
produce a characteristic mercurial dermatitis, some individuals being especially
sensitive to its irritating influence. It is not used upon surgical instruments in
any strength because of its corrosive action. It may be used as a gargle for the
throat and mouth, and to wash putrid abscess cavities, as well as the vagina and
bladder.

The bichloride in doses of from one-sixtieth to one-thirtieth of a grain
every two hours has been used successfully in malignant sore throat and
diphtheria. The patches are soon removed and the fever abates. We have
so many other agents of equal efficiency that have no depressing influence upon
the system that our practitioners seldom if ever use it for that purpose.

It is also used as an intestinal antiseptic in typhoid and other conditions
of this character, as has been previously stated.

Triturated minutely with sugar of milk, the corrosive chloride is efficacious in cholera infantum with watery discharges and green stools. The one
five hundredth of a grain is a sufficient dose. It is especially indicated where
the choleric character is distinctly pronounced. It is similar in its action to
arsenite of copper.

SODIUM PHOSPHATE.

Formula—Na, H(PO,).

Dose, from ten to one hundred grains.

Physiological Action—If the sodium phosphate, in from one dram to
one and one-half dram doses, be taken in cold water before breakfast, it produces a full, satisfactory and painless bowel movement, neutralizes excessive
gastric acidity, and promotes a sense of well-being. Its regular use overcomes
many cases of chronic constipation due to inactivity of the liver.

It improves the tone and greatly increases the functional activity of the
liver, and stimulates the functional activity of the glandular organs concerned
in digestion and food appropriation. It is an excellent eliminative if given in
doses of one-half dram three or four times daily. There is no cathartic effect,
but its stimulant effects are maintained and an admirable general tonic influence
induced. It is an actual brain and nerve food of rare value, a greatly underestimated remedy. To children it is given in doses of from three to ten grains
in some convenient menstruum, the dose repeated every two hours. It may be
given with the food of infants or dissolved in milk.

Specific Symptomatology—The Phosphate of Sodium in certain liver
disorders of infancy is specific. The specific conditions are white pasty stools,
often hard, sometimes spongy, so light in weight that they will sometimes float
+ on water. This indication is present when there is a deficiency of the biliary
secretion..

Therapy—The group of symptoms which this remedy will almost invariably cure are the following: general inanition and malaise, paleness of the
mucous membranes, and almost complete loss of appetite.

The child cries if laid on its back, or whenever moved, because of soreness of the muscles, is dull, inclined to sleep most of the time, always irritable, or often restless during the night, not sleeping long at a time. The temperature is sometimes less than normal, but often there is a variable temperature, and sometimes there is a remittent fever with morning and evening exacerbations or an intermittent fever and usually a slight rise in temperature.

In all cases there is a deficiency of the red blood corpuscles, and gradual,
sometimes rapid, emaciation; there is an excess of phosphates in the urine, because the phosphates of the system, which should supply the nutrition of the
osseous structures, are not performing that function, but are being excreted as a
waste product.

The symptoms above described suggest very many remedies or combinations of remedies, but the author has often dispensed with every other remedy, however strongly suggested, and depended upon the Phosphate of Sodium alone, and has seen the patient improve from the first. These symptoms
are the precursors of disease of the bones—caries, necrosis, rachitis, in fact
the above description accurately describes the earlier symptoms of rickets,
which may be often prevented by the early and persistent use of this remedy.

Co-Operatives—It acts in harmony with cholagogue cathartics, with

Specific Medicine Taraxacum. Dose, from five to sixty minims.

Physiological Action—This agent acts mildly upon the liver as a cholagogue, and in consequence its laxative influence is mild. It stimulates the flow
of bile into the duodenum, and encourages the eliminative changes carried on
by the liver. It encourages the proper elaboration and elimination of urea, and
the excretion of uric acid.

Therapy—It is valuable in combination with other remedies of similar
action, in chronic jaundice, in conditions attributable to auto-intoxication, in
rheumatism and in blood disorders, as an alterative. It is especially an alterative for chronic eruptions, and unhealthy conditions of the skin.

It will stimulate the stomach, and is useful in chronic catarrhal gastritis
with perversion of nutrition. In aphthous ulcerations of the mouth it is

PrEPARATIONS—Extractum Ceanothi Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Ceanothus.
Dose, from one-fourth to one dram.

Specific Medicine Ceanothus. Dose, from one-half minim to five minims
every two to four hours.

Physiological Action—Astringent, stimulant tonic to mucous surfaces,
and expectorant. It is to a certain extent mildly antiseptic. It is an alterative
of much power in its influence over the portal circulation.

Specific Symptomatology—It has a specific influence upon the portal
circle, influencing the circulation. In lymphatic patients, with sluggish circulation and inactivity of the liver of a chronic nature, with doughy-sallow skin,
puffy and expressionless face, pain in the liver or spleen with hypertrophy of
either or both organs, and constipation, it has a direct and satisfactory influence, especially if the conditions are of malarial origin.

Therapy—It overcomes indigestion and malassimilation under these circumstances, by its influence upon the portal circulation, and is thus a stomach
remedy of much value.

It is not so direct a remedy in acute inflammations of the liver and
spleen. When the above specific indications are present as a complication of
any chronic condition, or with syphilis or scrofula or in general glandular
disarrangements, the agent is indicated. Bronchitis, chronic pneumonitis and
asthma are found present with the above general symptoms. Ovarian and uterine irregularities with such conditions will also be benefited by its use.

POLYMNIA. POLYMNIA UVEDALIA.

Synonyms—Bearsfoot, leaf-cup, yellow leaf-cup.

PrEPARATIONS—Extractum Uvedalie Fluidum, Fluid Extract Uvedalia; not
miscible with water. Dose, three to fifteen drops every three hours, gradually
increased.

Specific Medicine Uvedalia. Dose, two to ten drops.

Physiological Action—Given in large doses polymnia acts as an emetocathartic, producing painful evacuations, with severe emesis, and if pushed
produces gastro-intestinal inflammation, dizziness, convulsions and even death.

Specific Symptomatology—lIt is indicated in conditions of inactivity of
the organs, with passive fullness of the circulation of the parts, or of surrounding tissues which may be of a sodden inelastic character. Inactive engorgements, or stagnations of the circulation, are general conditions pointing to the
use of this agent. Scudder gave as its indications full, flabby, sallow tissues,
impaired circulation, glandular enlargement and other impaired funtions from
lack of tone.

Therapy—The older writers of our school lauded this remedy as of
much importance in rheumatism. Others spoke of it favorably in the same
class of cases in which phytolacca is used. Dr. Pruitt used it in the form of
an ointment, in inflammation of the mammary glands, and other glandular
inflammations, especially if abscesses had formed. The specific influence of
the remedy, however, as agreed by all writers, is upon enlargement of the
spleen. This gland is influenced in chronic malarial conditions, in scrofulous
diseases and in tubercular difficulties. It is upon the malarial form of splenic
enlargement that it acts to the best advantage.

Therapy—It should be used freely internally, and externally the hot inSeal must be applied. Other marked indications may be met with selected
remedies..

It is indicated also in the glandular and structural hypertrophy of other
organs. A chronically enlarged inactive engorged liver, with tenderness on
pressure, is quickly and satisfactorily cured by it. A womb enlarged from
subinvolution or other hypertrophy, yields satisfactorily to its influence.

It has been used in mastitis or ‘‘caked breast’’ so-called, to excellent
advantage, but its prolonged use may suppress the secretion of milk. It is an
active stimulant to the removal of waste in all the conditions mentioned. The
removal of chronic inflammatory deposits stimulates the capillary circulation
Ee better action and relieves the aching pain and soreness common to such conitions.

It has been praised most highly in the treatment of rheumatism, lumbago, and other painful conditions dependent upon the imperfect
removal of the products of retrograde metamorphosis. It is a remedy of
much value in scrofulous conditions with glandular indurations or abscess.

Its external application has relieved many cases of severe spinal irritation, especially if present with the general conditions named above as indicating the use of this agent.

Dr. Scudder gave the following list of disorders, in which it had a direct
influence: Chronic enlargement of the spleen, chronic enlargement of the liver,
chronic hypertrophy of the cervix uteri, chronic gastritis, chronic metritis with
hypertrophy, uterine subinvolution and general glandular enlargement. The
remedy, no doubt, stands at the head of spleen remedies, but it is not used as
it should be, the younger physicians paying but little attention to it. It influences all of the ductless glands.

Dr. Felter says, when dyspepsia depends upon a sluggish circulation in
the gastric and hepatic arteries, and is attended with full, heavy, burning
sensation, in the parts supplied by these arteries, this is our remedy. It has
benefited leucocythemia. Its use should be persisted in for weeks. A common cause of failure in the treatment of chronic diseases is the lack of persistency.

The solid extract of polymnia is readily incorporated with any ointment
base, and the external use of the agent over enlarged glands is often as important as its internal use.:

Scudder claimed that it was the best hair tonic in the materia medica,
in the proportions of four ounces of the tincture with twelve ounces of bay rum,
to be rubbed thoroughly into the scalp. A good combination would be castor
oil three parts, glycerine one part, lanolin three parts, extract uvedalia two
parts, melted and rubbed together and cooled. This should be rubbed thoroughly into the roots of the hair. The addition of a very small quantity of
cantharides improves this in stubborn cases.

JUGLANS. JUGLANS CINEREA.

Synonym—Butternut.

ConsTITUENTS—A resin, juglandin, a fixed oil, juglandic acid.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Juglandis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Juglans.
Dose, from one minim to one-half dram.
an Tinctura Juglandis, Tincture of Juglans. Dose, from five minims to one

am.

Specific Medicine Juglans. Dose, from one-third to one minim; prescribed
from ten drops to one-half dram in four ounces of water, a teaspoonful every
one, two or three hours.

Juglandin. Dose, from one-fifth of a grain to one grain.

Physiological Action—Experiments with the drug have ascertained that
it influences, with great energy, the liver, small intestines, colon and rectum,
causing an increased manufacture and elimination of bile, as well as increased
activity of the glands of the intestinal tract. Full doses produce large bilious
evacuations, without much pain or griping, in which respect its action very
much resembles that of iris versicolor.

Therapy—It is said to be a valuable remedy in duodenal catarrh, with
torpidity of the liver and chronic jaundice. Small doses have been successfully employed in dysentery, bilious diarrhea, and in intestinal diseases,
with symptoms indicating irritability, hyperemia, or a tendency to inflammation. Chvonie constipation can be successfully corrected by medium doses
of the extract, if the affection depends upon defective elimination of bile, causing the stools to be clay-colored and dry from a lack of biliary and glandular
secretion.

Combined with other agents, as hyoscyamus, belladonna, nux vomica, leptandra or capsicum, a most excellent pill can be made, which will cure many
cases of the above conditions, and will stimulate the stomach and intestinal
tract, in those atonic or debilitated conditions which induce chronic dyspepsia.

In the skin disorders named under dandelion, pustular and eczematous, it will
act in the same manner as dandelion, and may be advantageously combined with
that agent.

It is specifically adapted to skin diseases associated with some abnormal
condition of the intestinal tract. Eczema, herpes circinatus, acne, impetigo,
pemphigus, rupia, prurigomoluscum, lichen and chronic scaly skin diseases,
yield to its influence with appropriate auxiliary measures. Irritation of
mucous membranes, chronic inflammation of the throat, eruption over the
body like that of scarlatina, noli me tangere, scrofulous enlargement of
glands, congestion and irritation of the respiratory and gastric mucous membranes, nursing sore mouth, ulcers in the mouth with constipation, rheumatism of the muscles in the lumbar region, yield to its influence.

Juglans cinerea has proved to be curative of a great variety of skin
diseases, whether scaly or pustular, whether characterized by papules or
bulle, as stated above, so long as the lesion is associated with some disorder
of digestion and assimilation.

It is analagous to arsenic in its action in squamous affections, and to sulphide of calcium in pustular diseases of the skin.

It may be used to advantage, both locally and internally, in chronic and illconditioned ulcers, stimulating waste and improving nutrition.

In the treatment of skin diseases with Juglans, a saturated tincture of
the fresh inner bark should be employed in small doses, at the same time
that the remedy is used as a local application. In obstinate cases of chronic
eczema, the local use of the juice of the fresh inner bark has hastened the
cure.

In bowel complaints of infants and children, in the constipation of nursing women, and in the commencing stages of diarrhea and dysentery the
syrup may be used, while the extract is the best form of the remedy as a
cathartic in intermittent fever, and whenever the remedy is employed as a
cathartic..

Juglans may be given in conjunction with berberis, phytolacca, or podophyllin when there are disorders that are induced by occipital headaches.

Synonym—Wahoo.

ConstirvENts—Euonymin, Atropurpurin, Asparagin, Euonic acid, resin,
wax, fixed oil.

PrePaRATIONS—Extractum Euonymi Siccum, dried Extract of Euonymus.
Dose, from one to three grains.

Specific Medicine Euonymus. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Extractum Euonymi Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Euonymus. Dose, from
one to three drams.

Physiological Action—The agent is actively cathartic and alterative to
an excellent extent, through its influence upon the function of the glandular
organs. It exercises a distinct tonic influence.

Specific Symptomatology—Indigestion with biliousness, constipation,
chronic intermittents with cachexia; pulmonary phthisis with night-sweats and
great weakness; dropsical affections following acute disease; in convalescence
from severe intermittent fever; enlargement of the liver; chronic bronchitis.

Therapy—Euonymus, or wahoo, is chiefly valuable as a tonic in malarial
cachexia. It is antiperiodic, but much feebler than quinine. In those cases
of indigestion and constipation with a yellowish tint of the conjunctiva, and

round the mouth, the tongue being coated and of a similar color, indicating a
cholagogue, euonymus is a good remedy.

In large doses, it is a drastic cathartic, causing emeto-catharsis and great
prostration.

It is a general nutritive tonic, and may be employed where mandrake is
beneficial, in torpid liver and bilious states, with weak digestion, constipation,
and lithemic neuralgia.

It acts as a hepatic stimulant, improving the protoplasmic function of
the liver, and increasing the production of bile.

Its cholagogue power has been demonstrated by experiments on dogs, as
well as when employed in the treatment of the human subject.

In ial disease, after the fever has been broken, and in protracted
convalescence, it is especially valuable as a tonic.

In chronic pulmonary complaints, it improves digestion, and gives tone
to the respiratory organs, acting as an expectorant.

SAPIUM. SAPIUM SALIOIFOLIUM.

Synonym—Yerba de la flecha.

Part EmMpLovepD—The root, bark and leaves.

Locatiry—Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona.

PrEPARATIONS—Powdered Root. Dose, from one-half to one grain.

Fluid Extract. Dose, from one to five minims.

Infusion. Two ounces of the root to one pint of water. Dose, from twenty
to thirty minims.

Physiological Action—In large ‘doses it is poisonous, produces dysentery, vertigo and death from prostration and nervous exhaustion.

Sapium Salicifolium is an energetic cathartic and diuretic, produces copious liquid discharges without griping. In minute doses at intervals of four
hours it stimulates the torpid liver up to its normal action, also increases the
flow of urine and exerts a direct influence on the kidneys and urinary passages.

Therapy—In bilious colic caused by presence of calculous matter, sapium
salicifolium combined with mono-bromated camphor promptly dislodges the
gravel, calms the nervous system and quiets the distressed stomach.

The principal advantage the drug has over other cathartics and diuretics
is its superior efficacy, its pleasing taste, besides its antilithic properties; the
agent is not widely known. The small and pleasant dose and kindly action will
give it a place as an efficient cathartic, if the above statements are confirmed.

Agents Used as Hydragogue Cathartics.

HYDRAGOGUE CATHARTICS 381

Specific Medicine Elaterium. Dose, one-third to fifteen minims.

The specific medicine is one of the most energetic of all ordinary preparations. It precipitates upon addition to water, and to avoid a concentrated dose,
a mixture must be thoroughly shaken each time before administration. It has
a characteristic clear green color.

Physiological Action—Hydragogue cathartic, diuretic. Large doses
may kill by causing inflammation of the stomach and bowels.

Therapy—Dropsies of a general character are relieved at once by elaterium. It produces such hydragogue action as to at once unload the cellular
tissues, of serum. It produces such gastro-intestinal irritation, however, in excessive doses, that caution must always be exercised in its administration. If
violent vomiting is produced, its influence upon the dropsy is not marked. It
exercises a powerful derivative influence and is a depleting agent of marked
potency. It is in almost universal use in the treatment of dropsy among old
school physicians.

In the treatment of cystitis, elaterium in small doses is used with excellent results by many physicians.

Both King and Scudder recommended it in chronic and acute cystitis and
in nephritis, especially in inflammation of the neck of the bladder. They produced its hydragogue action for its derivative influence first, by half drachm.
doses of the tincture until its full influence was obtained, subsequently they
gave smaller doses. Recent authorities claim cures of a satisfactory character
by the use of from ten to twenty drops of the specific remedy in four ounces of
water, a teaspoonful every two or three hours. It is deserving of extended trial.

JALAP. IPOMGA JALAPA.

Part Employed—The tuberous root.

ConstituENTs—Convolvulin, jalapin, gum, albumen, salts.

PREPARATION.—Extractum Jalape, Extract of Jalap. Dose, from five to
fifteen grains.

Pulvis Jalape Compositus, U. S. P. Dose, from ten to thirty grains.

Pulvis Jalape Compositus, A. D., Compound Powder of Jalap, Beach’s
Antibilious Physic. Dose, one dram.

Therapy—Jalap is an active cathartic. With the older physicians it
was commonly used, but the modern school apparently does not often find a
need for it. It produces large alvine or watery evacuations with griping, and
extreme nausea in some cases. Hypercatharsis and continued colic are induced
by it. It influences the small intestines most directly. In cases of chronic inactivity of the intestinal tract, with persistent constipation and inactivity of the
glandular organs, it will increase their action; will cleanse the entire tract and
stimulate normal action. It is an old remedy for dropsy. It is superseded by

other and more satisfactory agents.

HELLEBORUS. HELLEBORUS NIGER.

Synonym—Black Hellebore.

ConstITvENts—Helleborin, helleborein, gum, resin, fat.

PREPARATIONS—Vinum Hellebori Compositum, Compound Wine of Hellebore. Dose, one-half ounce to two ounces.

Specific Medicine Hellebore. Dose, one-tenth to three minims.

Physiological Action—Black Hellebore, when locally applied, causes
irritation of mucous membranes and of the conjunctiva, inducing redness,

swelling and increased secretion. A moderate dose taken internally produces
no effect, but a considerable quantity causes loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting,
pain and inflammation of the stomach and bowels. Medicinal doses strengthen
the heart and increase the force of the pulse; while toxic doses cause paralysis
with rapid pulse and sudden arrest of the heart. The effect on the nervous
system is partial paralysis with tremors, followed by violent convulsions.

The agent in its maximum dosage is a drastic hydragogue cathartic in its
fresh active form. It is emetic also and emmenagogue. In overdoses it readily
produces hyper-catharsis and hyper-emesis. It is a constituent of proprietary
pills, but is not widely used in general medicine. In small doses it acts as a
stimulant to the liver and to the secretory glands of the gastro-intestinal tract.

Therapy—lIn hysteria, melancholy, mania and other mental conditions in
= the abdominal organs are seriously at fault, it is prescribed with

enefit.

The agent is prescribed in dropsical conditions where there is great inactivity on the part of the liver, with torpidity of bowels, with general anasarca or
pericarditis or hydrothorax. It is not always the best remedy even in these
conditions.

The agent is a local anesthetic, especially to the conjunctiva. Helleborein,
a crystalline glucoside, in solution dropped into the eye, will produce anethesia
of the structures through the cornea while the sensibility of the contiguous

’ structure’ is not impaired. It is not in general use for this purpose.

Where there is burning of the skin, sensitiveness in distinct areas, especially of the nates and thighs or flashes of heat, hellebore is specific. It is
given from five to twenty drops in four ounces of water; a teaspoonful every

our.

Physiological Action—This is a drastic hydragogue cathartic. It is exceedingly irritating and produces a profound revulsive or derivative effect.

Therapy—In apoplexy or in sudden paralysis from cerebral hyperemia,
or from rupture of the cerebral vessels, a profound derivative influence may
be at once obtained from an active dose of croton oil. In acute cerebritis,
or in meningitis, or in violent delirium, or furious mania in adults, it is sometimes beneficial. Its use in accordance with present methods of treatment is
very limited, many physicians finding no place for it at all.

Its external use produces active counter-irritation. This pronounced influence was once thought a necessary measure in pneumonitis and pleuritis,
and it was freely used in inflammatory rheumatism, and in sciatica and
other persistent neuralgias. It was used in cerebral and cerebro-spinal
meningitis, and in cases of excitable delirium and acute mania.

Its influence is too irritating and prostrating for dropsical cases which are
usually enfeebled from disease.

MAGNESIUM SULPHATE.

Formula—MgSO,7H,0.

Synonyms—Epsom salt, Sulphate of Magnesium.

Administration—For general administration it is better to give this
agent in a hot solution. Usually one-half of the otherwise necessary dose will
accomplish the same result if hot. It is stated that if an ounce be boiled for a
short time in a pint of water to which a grain or two of tannic acid is added,
it will be entirely deprived of its bitterness. In solution in hot milk, it is of
value in debilitated patients. The dose as a hydragogue is from half an ounce
to an ounce, well diluted. As an aperient and antacid, from ten to thirty
grains will prove satisfactory.

HYDRAGOGUE CATHARTICS 333

Physiological Action—By osmotic processes, this agent abstracts water
directly from the intestinal capillaries. This explains the efficient influence
of the remedy in dropsy. Its solutions are not readily absorbed, and it directly stimulates intestinal peristaltic action. Concentrated solutions of the
agent are more active in abstracting water, and thus more efficient when
given for the reduction of dropsical effusions. The solutions so concentrated
must be avoided if there be no dropsy. While epsom salt is considered perfectly safe, it has produced death in overdoses. Concentrated solutions when
dropsy is not present occasionally produce from rapid absorption of the drug,
marked constitutional effects, and death may occur, from convulsions or from
suppression of urine. There has been extreme vomiting and paralysis. The
agent is also poisonous when solutions are injected directly into the blood
stream. There is a pronounced influence upon the respiratory apparatus with
sudden respiratory failure.

Therapy—This agent is demanded when a non-irritating cathartic is
needed, which will produce copious watery stools without nausea or pain.
It is of much service in abdominal surgery, thoroughly evacuating the intestinal canal prior to an operation. Given in small doses it stimulates normal
secretion, causes liquid feces and prevents any possible impaction. This is
accomplished without stimulating the peristalsis to any great extent, or
otherwise disturbing the muscular structure of the bowels.

It is a most available remedy in dropsy. If the skin is cool, it eliminates
large quantities of water through the kidneys as well as from the intestinal
canal.

If the character of the kidney disease is such that active elimination is
undesirable, it will cause active transpiration through the skin instead, if
the skin be thoroughly warm and moist at the time of its administration.

If the patient is greatly debilitated, it will not produce increased weakness, if it is given in conjunction with the carbonate of iron or some other
mild, well selected tonic. If given when the stomach is empty, it seems to
act more directly upon the kidneys, as a diuretic.

In the treatment of dysentery, given in small doses, it is an efficient remedy. It apparently has a soothing instead of an irritating effect, as have
most cathartics in this disease.

It is valuable in impaction of the bowels from any cause. In this case
fifteen grains of the salt with an equal amount of the bitartrate of potassium every two hours will produce satisfactory results. This combination
is also useful as an antacid and refrigerant in many of the disordered conditions of the stomach and bowels during hot weather.

If the agent be administered in full doses in colica pictonum it will serve
an excellent purpose. Inasmuch as sulphuric acid is a direct antidote in lead
poisoning, the dilute acid may be added in small quantities to a solution of
this remedy.

Dr. Vogler claims that it will produce sleep where the cause depends
upon indigestion or constipation if given in dram doses. It is used both internally and externally in rheumatism.

I have had many reports during the last two years of the application of
a solution of an ounce of epsom salt in a pint of boiling water to which ten
or fifteen drops of carbolie acid has been added. This is not only beneficial
wherever a fomentation is required but is a superior application, Dr. Gordon says, in the treatment of erysipelas.

There is a peculiar disease of the skin in old people characterized by a
hard incrusted condition, dusky red or purplish, which cracks and bleeds,
and fissures with a slimy exudate at times, which Dr. Waterhouse cures satisfactorily with the above solution.

Where the patient has a large number of warts which persist in spite of
treatment, from two to five grains of epsom salts four or five times a day
with a drop or two of thuja will cure, Dr. Webster says, in a short time.

As 8 pain reliever, this agent has come into prominence during the past
few years, through the teachings of many observers: Burgess of Chattanooga
claims it to be distinctly anesthetic. Externally applied in concentrated hot
solutions, it often exhibits this influence satisfactorily for local inflammations. It was suggested for intra-spinal injections to control tetanus, and at
one time to induce temporary anesthesia of the extremities and of the pelvic
organs, but serious results followed its use in so many cases that it has now
been largely abandoned.

Dr. Cooper advises the agent in ounce doses of the saturated solution
every two hours in the treatment of amebic dysentery. After the first active
operations, he gives thirty drops of this solution until the patient has entirely recovered, using starch water and laudanum, if necessary for the
tenesmus, and aconite in fever.

When salt rheum so called is present on the hands and fingers, he immerses the parts in warm solution for ten or fifteen minutes, at bedtime. Then
draws on clean white cotton gloves for the night, repeating this each night
until cured..

Where the urine scalds or burns in passing from high acidity, he cures
with teaspoonful doses of this solution four times a day. Extreme gastric
acidity is relieved by small doses frequently repeated.

He treats simple conjunctivitis by dropping a few drops of the saturated
solution into the eye, to which is added two grains of cocaine to the ounce,
He treats ascaris scabei with hot concentrated solutions applied at bedtime.

Dr. Burgess advised the use of this agent to reduce excessive fat. He
treated a patient weighing 238 pounds, reducing him to his normal weight,
178 pounds at the rate of about ten pounds per month. His method was to
bathe the body night and morning with a solution of one ounce of the salt
to a pint of water. At the same time a teaspoonful of the same strength solution was taken internally three times a day.

The above course is recommended to reduce the quantity of uric acid
in the system when excessive.

To unsightly and disfiguring scars, he applied the same solution preferably hot, twice daily. By so doing, he reduced them to a great degree, sometimes removing them entirely. Dr. Broadnax suggested that this treatment
might prevent cancers, which develop in scars.

CROTON OIL. TIGLI. OLEUM.

Part Employed—A fixed oil expressed from the seeds of the croton tiglium.

ConstTITUENTS—Glucosides of tiglinic, formic, isobutyrie and other acids.
The vesicating principle is soluble in alcohol, while the purgative principle
is insoluble.

Administration—The dose of the oil is from one to two minims, best administered in emulsion or pill form. It is not to be administered if there
is gastric or intestinal irritation or inflammation, or if there is great weakness or prostration.

A single drop is usually a sufficient dose. This may be administered
disguised in anything the patient can be made to take. Dropped on the
tongue it acts quickly. Two drops will produce violent action in most cases.

POTASSIUM AND SODIUM TARTRATE.

The Comparative Action of Sodium and Potassium Salts.

The physician, in his study of the compounds of sodium and potassium,
finds himself considering the action of the substance with which these elements are combined, rather than the influence of the element itself. All the
elements entering into the construction of a chemical compound influence the
therapeutic action of that compound to a greater or less extent, although
the influence for which the compound is usually prescribed, is that of the
most active element in the compound.

Of the two elements, sodium is much milder in its influence upon the
system than potassium, and yet the compounds of the latter have long been
most commonly used. Potassium in large doses is an irritant poison, and its
salts produce effects by virtue of this action, which may be avoided by using
the same compounds of sodium, which, although an irritant, is not so to any
extent comparable with potassium.

The influence of potassium in its compounds is to suspend the functional
operations of the muscular and nervous structures. This is plainly apparent
in its action upon muscular contractility, notably that of the heart, the action
of which is retarded and its power of contractility reduced by the potassium
salts to an extent from ten to fifteen times greater than by the sodium salts.
When in combination with bromine, this property would, in many cases, increase the action of the bromine, and thus prove desirable, as when administered for an excitable condition of the heart, in sthenic conditions, or in
over-sexual excitement, or conditions where there is excitability of the circulation, local or general, with hyperemia, with greatly increased muscular
and arterial tension.

The influence: of potassium upon the mucous membranes and glandular
structures of the stomach and intestinal canal is more irritating, and interferes with the functional action of these structures to a much greater extent
than sodium. The sodium salt is appropriated much more readily and is
more kindly received, and can be given with a satisfactory influence upon
the stomach when disorders of that organ complicate the general condition.

This fact is confirmed by the common use of the sodium compounds instead of those of potassium in gastric acidity, and in general disorders of the
stomach and intestinal canal.

It will be observed that where the general functions of the organs of
the gastro-intestinal tract are impaired, the sodium compounds, for whatever
purpose prescribed, will exercise a more desirable influence, but in conditions
where these organs are intact, and there is exalted heart action and an exaggerated arterial tonus, the potassium compounds may be preferable.

The more soothing influence of the sodium compounds upon the mucous
structures facilitates their absorption, and this perceptibly promotes their
action. It is often observed that the same results are obtained from the use
of five or six grain doses of the sodium bromide or iodide, as are accom-

plished by no less than ten grains of similar potassium compounds, because
of the more ready appropriation of the sodium compounds. Their lack of
irritable properties facilitates their elimination also.

SODIUM CARBONATE.

Formula—Na,CO,10H,0.

Synonyms—Sal soda, washing soda.

The agent is freely soluble in water, but insoluble in alcohol and ether.
Its physiological properties are similar to those of the other salts of sodium
and potassium. Its general influence is considered under the consideration
of alkaline agents.

It is the analogue of potassium carbonate, as efficient and milder in its
action than that salt, in specific application.

SODIUM BICARBONATE.

Formula—NaHCo,,.

Synonym—Acid Sodium Carbonate.

Physiological Action—This agent increases the alkalinity of the blood.
It is readily diffusible and rapidly neutralizes excess of acidity. It increases
the alkalinity of the urine during the presence of the salt in the system, but
usually after its withdrawal the acidity is considerably increased. This increase of acidity is apparent when the agent is administered continuously in
the treatment of gastric hyperacidity. Its free continuous administration is
apt to be injurious to the stomach.

Therapy—It is beneficial if given after meals in hyperacidity due to
fermentation. In cases of deficient secretion of the gastric juice it should be
given half an hour before meals.

Dr. Sternberg treated thirty cases of yellow fever by the use of this salt
alone, with recovery in every case. In all cases of severe diarrhea with excessive acid reaction it will produce good results.

It is an old remedy in the treatment of inflammation of the bladder.
Woodbury advised ten grains in half an ounce of an infusion of uva-ursi,
given every two hours. He claimed immediate results in acute cystic inflammation. In such a case, however, it will be important to consider the reaction of the urine and administer the agent before or after meals as indieated by the reaction.

Externally the agent seems to possess antiseptic properties. Because of
the presence of carbon, with its alkaline reaction the agent is applicable to
burns; applied in the form of a moist paste it will relieve the pain at once
in ee cases. It may be removed after a few hours and proper dressing
applied.

It is considered a beneficial remedy in the treatment of eczema, many
authorities advising its use. A strong solution applied to a surface poisoned
by rhus toxicodendron will usually give quick relief.

In the treatment of some forms of indolent ulcer its persistent application will relieve pain, reduce swelling, and check the formation of pus.

In a general way the agent is advantageous in the treatment of leucorrhoea, especially if the discharge has an acid reaction. It is freely used in
solution as a douche.

SODIUM POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM COMPOUNDS 337

It is also useful as an irrigating fluid in cases of cystitis where there is a
strong acid reaction with a deposit of urates and uric acid.

SODIUM SULPHATE.

Formula—Na,SO,10H,0.

Synonym—Glauber’s salt.

Physiological Action—It has long been in use as an active, hydragogue
cathartic. In small doses it is laxative, aperient and diuretic. When the
powder is given, one-half the usual dose only is needed, as it has lost onehalf its weight in the loss of its water of crystallization.

Its action is in every way similar to that of the magnesium sulphate,
which is preferable because of its superior palatability and more kindly
action. It was at one time advised as a specific remedy for opacity of the
cornea. The dry, powdered crystals were applied directly to the eyeball,
once or twice daily. This salt was popular with the fathers of our school in
the compound known as white liquid physic. This preparation was made by
dissolving half a pound of the sodium sulphate in one and one-half pints of
water; to this, an ounce each of nitric and hydrochloric acids was added.
Of this a tablespoonful was given every hour until free evacuation occurred.

Although very efficacious in many conditions, this compound would blast
the reputation of the modern physician, by its disagreeable taste.

Therapy—Sodium sulphate is given in hepatic congestion with suppression of the bile. It is a good agent in chronic jaundice and in catarrh of
the bile ducts where there is constipation with clay-colored feces.

It is valuable in biliary and renal calculi. It has a modifying influence
upon the urine and is beneficial in catarrh of the bladder, where the urine is
of a strongly acid reaction.

SODIUM SULPHITE.

Formula—Na,So,. 7H,O.

Administration—The dose of the salt is from two to twenty grains.
Ten grains in solution is about the maximum for usual prescription. It may
be given every two or three hours. The principal objection to its use is its
unpleasant taste, which is difficult to conceal.

Specific Symptomatology—Scudder laid great stress upon the use of
this remedy when there is pallor of the tissues of the tongue, which is broad
and coated with a dirty fur, or with a whitish or yellowish thick, moist coat.

This agent prevents fermentation in the gastro-intestinal canal. It is
specific for vomiting of frothy or yeasty matter because it destroys the
microscopic fungi torula cerevisie and sarcina ventriculi which are present
in this vomited matter. Under these circumstances, the cause being removed, nervous excitement abates, the pulse and temperature are reduced,
digestion and appropriation are encouraged. The condition may be present
in all acute, eruptive or inflammatory fevers. It should not be depended
upon to fulfill other than the conditions named. The other evidences should
be met in each case with the properly indicated remedy.

Therapy—When the indications for the use of the remedy are present
with general indisposition, without the presence of any recognized disease,
this agent alone may be all that is necessary for a cure.

In aphthous conditions of the mouth, or of other mucous surfaces due to
parasitic causes, this agent acts with extreme rapidity.

A solution of this salt is sometimes applied to foul smelling ulcers, to
phlegmonous abscesses where vegetation is apt to be present, or where gangrene is threatened.

In the treatment of small-pox, erysipelas, and in some cases of typhus
and typhoid fevers with all the indications present, this agent performs a
very important service.

SODIUM HYPOSULPHITE.

Formula—Na,S.0,. 5H,0.

Synonym—Sodium thiosulphate.

Physiological Action—In physiological action, this agent has all the
properties of the sulphite, intensified. It is specifically opposed to fermentation. It is exceedingly popular among veterinarians because of its influence over this process, which is a common source of disease in horses and
cattle. The fermentation of large masses of food in the stomach of these
animals is the common cause for flatulent colic. It is indicated also in
diseases which result from fermentation or zymosis in the blood. It decreases the uric acid and sulphates and causes the appearance of oxalic acid
in the urine.

Therapy—lIt is an active agent in parasitic skin disease or in ulcerations
of the skin or mucous membrane due to this cause, such as cycosis, impetigo,
scabies and favus. It is specific in yeasty vomiting, and will serve an excellent purpose in the treatment of parasitic disease of the mouth.

Solutions of this salt may be atomized or vaporized and inhaled in fetid
bronchitis, in pulmonary inflammation with purulent discharge, and more
especially in gangrene of the lungs.

The dose of this salt is from two to fifteen grains, repeated often if
necessary.

As a single remedy in the treatment of small pox, this agent has been
recommended very strongly, used both internally, and externally in the form
of a saturated solution applied freely over the eruption. Used in the early
stages, the disease is rendered mild. Twenty-grain doses four times a day
ae adults, and from two to five grains for children is about the correct

losage.

SODIUM CHLORIDE.
Formula—NaCl.

Synonyms—Common table salt, Sea Salt, Muriate of Soda—white crystalline powder, permanent in the air, soluble in two and eight-tenths parts of
cold water and in two and one-half parts of boiling water. Very slightly
soluble in alcohol. Insoluble in ether and chloroform.

Physiological Action—Salt is an essential constituent in the animal economy. It is in the strictest sense of the word a trophic. It is more than a tonic
because a food.

Therapeutically in large doses it is emetic and cathartic. It is refrigerant, and in small doses antiseptic, astringent, and anthelmintic.

Therapy—tIn narcotic poisoning it is dissolved in warm water and produces immediate emesis. It is a chemical antidote to the nitrate of silver.
Doses of ten or fifteen grains in solution five or six times a day will cure some
cases of obstinate constipation.

SODIUM POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM COMPOUNDS 339

It has been used with good effect in intermittent fever given in the intermission in doses of half an ounce to an ounce. In hemoptysis, half a teaspoonful
taken dry will frequently stop the hemorrhage.

In its external use, it has a wider field. Hot solutions of salt persisted
in are of unfailing benefit in local inflammation of the lungs, liver, spleen,
pleura or peritoneum, and especially of the kidneys. It is most serviceable
in inflammation of the joints, either traumatic, rheumatic or tubercular in
character, and in inflammation of the throat or tonsils, either malignant or
benign. Hot saturated compresses are applied. The solution may be used
as a gargle, and is sometimes of greater value if a small quantity of vinegar
is added. It is useful in the inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, and
in glandular inflammations.

In some cases of granular opthalmia, dilute solutions applied are of
service. It is a popular domestic remedy in the treatment of catarrh, acute
and chronic. It is an essential constituent of nearly all advertised catarrh
cures.

A few grains diysolved in hot water, drawn into the nostrils from the palm
of the hand, or applied with a douche, will benefit atrophic rhinitis. One
pound of salt dissolved in about four gallons of water produces a salt bath
of about the same consistency as sea water.

Physiological Salt Solution.

Occurrence—A solution of sodium chloride, which represents in relative
strength the fluids of the body, and which is known as the physiological salt
solution is made by adding one part of salt to 130 parts of water. It is extemporaneously approximated by adding one drachm of salt to one pint of
sterilized water.

However, recent careful observation has determined the necessity of a
greater accuracy in preparing this solution. Furthermore, the presence of
both calcium and potassium in small quantities have been found to increase
the efficiency of the solution. The following formula from Hare’s Materia
Medica is now determined to be more nearly correct:

Calcium chloride.......... 0. cee cece cece eee ee eens 0.25
Potassium chloride. 0.
Sodium chloride.......

The above authority has suggested a concentrated solution which can be
found upon the market containing the proper ingredients in the proper quantities, from which an accurate normal saline solution can be immediately prepared.

Therapy—This solution is indicated where sudden shock suspends the
function of the medulla oblongata, and the heart’s action, or where there is
acute anemia from sudden loss of a large quantity of blood, either from
primary or secondary hemorrhage, or in violent diarrheeas where the circulation is suddenly deprived of a large proportion of its fluid constituent, as
in epidemic cholera. It was first thought to be beneficial only when injected
slowly into a large vein. This is the most direct method of introduction, and
should be resorted to when death seems imminent. If there seem to be a few
moments to spare, it may be carefully injected into the cellular tissue beneath the skin, anywhere in the body, usually in the abdomen, slowly injecting ounce after ounce, until six or eight ounces every two hours are injected,
changing the point of injection and carefully rubbing the swelling produced
by its introduction. In some cases it will do much good by its introduction
into the rectum in larger quantity, if it is held by a compress over the anus.

Its temperature could range from 98 to 104 degrees, according to the method
of introduction adopted, and the condition of the patient.

Dr. John B. Murphy of Chicago has suggested a method for the introduction of the normal salt solution into the rectum. It has been found to be superior in many cases to the immediate introduction of a large quantity of the
fluid. An apparatus is devised so that the flow of the liquid can be controlled
and the patient being placed in a recumbent position, the solution is introduced
continuously drop by drop at a temperature of about 102 degrees. The apparatus used is difficult of description, and cannot be illustrated here, but it can
now be found in most surgical instrument stores.

A simpler form of apparatus is suggested by Dr. Neuman of St. Louis in
which a glass percolator is held in position, as the fountain, by an ordinary
percolator stand. The fluid is placed in an upper percolator dropping directly
into the lower percolator. The fluid retained in this percolator by a stop cock
on the outgoing tube below is heated by an electric bulb, which is placed into
it, whenever necessary and for as long a time as necessary, to retain the heat at
the desired point. From the tube on the lower percolator compressed as desired,
the fluid flows drop by drop into the rectum over a continuous period of time.

It is important that the solution be carefully prepared, as variations from
about eight-tenths of a one per cent solution will vary the osmotic influence of
the solution. The slow delivery of the fluid will not require that the lower
funnel on the percolator rack shall be even as high as twelve inches above the
anus. It is found desirable in cases of inflammation of the perineum or acute
colitis, but this solution should be continued day by day..

LIQUOR POTASSZ.

A solution of potassium hydrate in water. It contains five per cent of the
It.

Therapy—it is caustic—irritating and acrid in its influence upon mucous
surfaces or upon the skin. It is replaced for internal use to a superior advantage, by salts of potassium or by aqua calcis. It is serviceable as a clinical reagent.

POTASSIUM CARBONATE.

Formula—K_,CO,.

Synonym—Salt of tartar.

Therapy—Its uses are the same as those of potassium bicarbonate, but
it is more harsh and irritating in its action. It neutralizes excess of acid in
the stomach, prevents the excessive formation of uric acid, is an active
diuretic, stimulates the action of the liver by exciting the function of that
organ, and produces watery discharges.

It corrects heartburn, pyrosis, morning sickness of pregnancy, when due
to acidity, and acid dyspepsia.

The agent is an antilithic of some value. It is an old time remedy for
gout, and corrects the free deposit of crystallized uric acid in the urine. It
was long called a remedy for gravel, but the uric acid gravel, not the gravel
of alkaline urine, is corrected by it. It is not apt to produce flatulence. It is
given in rheumatism only when the excessive acid conditions named are present.

SODIUM POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM COMPOUNDS 341
POTASSIUM BICARBONATE.

Formula—KHCoO,.

Synonyms—Kali Bicarbonicum, Acid Carbonate of Potassium.

Physiological Action—The presence of an organic acid in this class of
compounds in union with the basic radical renders them direct in appropriation
and efficient in action. This agent is similar in manner of action to the carbonate, but it is more acceptable to the stomach, and of mild taste. It is not
as agreeable as the sodium bicarbonate, which will replace it in all particulars. It prevents the formation of an excess of uric acid and opposes
lithemia.

Therapy—It is given in rheumatism and gout, and in all conditions
where there is chronic acidity of the stomach. The salt is given in doses of from
five to sixty grains in solution. Smaller doses persisted in are better than
occasional large ones.

POTASSIUM CITRATE.

Pormula—K,C,H,0,H,0.

Synonym—Citrate of *Potassium.

Therapy—It is a cooling diaphoretic, and has long been used in the
treatment of fevers. If it is dissolved in an excess of lemon juice, its virtues
are enhanced. Such a solution is of value in rheumatism, in rheumatic
fevers, and in all lithemic conditions.

POTASSIUM BITARTRATE.

Formula—KHC,H,0,.

Synonyms—Bitartrate of Potassium, Cream of Tartar, Acid Tartrate of
Potassium.

Therapy—This agent is a very mild laxative, and must be given in sufficient doses to produce its effect. It produces watery discharges, and in adequate doses acts as a stimulating diuretic. In small doses, it is a cooling aperient.

It is an irritant to the gastro-intestinal apparatus if its use be persisted
in. Because of its hydragogue effect, this agent is in common use in reducing dropsical effusions. It is especially useful when the urine has an ammonieal odor, is alkaline in reaction, and deposits a thick heavy sediment.
An infusion of juniper or digitalis will sometimes enhance its effects in dropsy.
If a teaspoonful of this salt be added to half a pint of water, to which the juice
of half a lemon be added, the whole well-sweetened with white sugar, a cooling,
palatable drink is prepared, which is of much service in fevers.

Combined with equal parts of sulphur, and given in teaspoonful doses,
the agent was once commonly used in constipation, where the intestinal secretion was deficient. It is beneficial in hemorrhoids under the same circumstances.
POTASSIUM AND SODIUM TARTRATE.

Formula—KNaC,H,0,. 4H,0.

Synonym—Rochelle salt.

Therapy—tThis agent is a mild purgative, and is especially useful in that
class of cases, in which an alkaline salt is needed to relax the bowels where
irritation exists and violent action must be avoided.


<!-- chunk -->

It is not unpleasant to the taste, and is most kindly in its action. In
small doses, it neutralizes excessive acidity of the urine. Combined with the
bi-carbonate of soda and tartaric acid in fine powder, it forms the well known
Seidlitz powder. The sodium bicarbonate and this salt are mixed intimately
and wrapped in blue papers, the tartaric acid in white paper. These are dissolved separately in cold water and then mixed, and the solution is drunk during effervescence.

Half an ounce of the potassium and sodium tartrate is necessary to produce purgative action, operating more quickly if dissolved in hot water.

LIQUOR CALCIS.

Synonyms—Aqua Calcis, solution of Calcium Hydrate, Lime Water.

Therapy—This solution is a common neutralizing agent, aritacid, slightly
astringent, commonly given in acid dyspepsia, and in acid conditions attended
with diarrhea. It is a domestic agent in the treatment of infantile disorders.
It is the common belief that all stomach disorders are due to excess of acid,
and the agent is often given without discrimination. In cases where milk
coagulates in hard curds, it will neutralize the excess of acid and retard the
coagulation.

The remedy is said to be of value as a spray in diphtheria and croup, but
we have so many more efficient remedies that it is not used. The vapor of lime
water is inhaled to excellent advantage in cases of membranous croup by
throwing large pieces of lime into an open vessel, containing hot water, and
continuing the steam with the patient under a cover.

A soapy mixture of lime water and linseed oil, known as carron oil, is
the old treatment for burns and scalds. Lime water internally for crops of
boils was once in common use.

MAGNESIUM OXIDE.
Formula—Mg0..

Synonyms—Magnesia, Calcined Magnesia, Light Magnesia, Magnesia
usta.
Therapy—This substance is a mild laxative. It is antacid to a practicable degree and in no way objectionable, if it is not permitted to accumulate
in the intestinal canal. It is indicated in sick headaches, when the tongue is
thick and uniformly covered with a white coating, and the mucous membranes are pale. There are sour cructations and nausea, constipation, general lassitude and indisposition and recurring headache, in acute attacks the
headache persisting for days.

In such a condition, antacids of any character—the sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium salts are positively indicated, but the calcined magnesia
is, perhaps, most commonly used.

The agent exerts but little effect if there is no excess of acid. In its relaxing influence, it acts slowly, and if excessive acid is present, the bowel movements are watery, and, usually, more or less feculent. The agent is given in all
diseases complicated with derangement of the stomach from hyperacidity,
as the progress of a disease is always encouraged and recovery greatly delayed, by a seriously deranged condition of the stomach and assimilative
organs.

The alkaline reaction of this substance renders it valuable in neutralizing
the concentrated acids when poisoning has occurred from them. It should be


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 336

SODIUM POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM COMPOUNDS 348

used in every case, if possible, instead of the carbonate, as the latter substance
gives off its carbonic acid gas during the process of neutralization so freely that
in some cases, where the disintegration of the coats of the stomach has been
sufficiently great, rupture or perforation of these have occurred from distention.
It is useful in arsenic poisoning, but is not as reliable as the iron sesquioxide.
If the administration of this agent be persisted in, when no excess of the
acid is present in the stomach or bowels, it will neutralize the normal acid, and
accumulate within the canal, acid drinks being sometimes necessary for its
removal.

MAGNESIUM CARBONATE.

Formula—Mg.CO,.

Administration—As an antacid from ten to twenty grains is the dose,
and if repeated at intervals of once an hour it acts as a physic and purgative.
If first rubbed up thoroughly with a little syrup or glycerine, it can be easily
combined with water for administration, otherwise it does not readily mix in
water.

In regard to its action the statements made concerning calcined magnesia, are in nearly every case applicable to this agent. It is a pleasant remedy, agreeable and efficacious in its administration in all acid conditions. It
is actively antacid, laxative in acid diarrheas, but inert and accumulative
in alkaline conditions.

Therapy—lIt is applicable where the calcined magnesia is indicated. The
objection to its use, which renders calcined magnesia preferable, is that it
must of necessity liberate its carbonic acid in the stomach or intestinal canal,
and thus produce flatulence, and, in some cases, temporarily painful distention, an especially objectionable feature in children. In sick headaches and
in persistent nausea and vomiting from extreme acidity, in adults, however,
this is sometimes a desirable feature, the gas acting as a stimulant and the
distention arousing the muscular action of the stomach.

Effervescent Magnesium Citrate.

This popular salt is prepared by first intimately mixing magnesium carbonate and citric acid with a few minims of water, to form a thick paste. This is
dried at a low temperature and finely powdered. This powder is then intimately
mixed with sodium bicarbonate, more powdered citric acid, and a little sugar.
The whole is dampened with a little aleohol and rubbed through a coarse sieve
and dried. It is kept dry in well closed vessels. It is in the form of a coarse,
granular powder, white, deliquescent in the air with liberation of the carbonic
acid, very soluble in water, with active effervescence. The solution is active
in its reactions. From one-half to two drams is the dose, stirred into a glass
of water, and drunk while effervescing, usually administered in doses of from
one-half to three teaspoonfuls in sufficient water.

Solution Magnesium Citrate.. In the manufacture of the solution of the citrate—Liquor Magnesii
Citratis—the constituents, except sodium bicarbonate, are mixed in a strong

bottle with the syrup of citric acid. The bottle is nearly filled with water, and
when ready to seal, sodium bicarbonate is added, and the bottle securely closed.
The action of this solution, and the salt in solution is the same.

Therapy—This preparation is probably the most pleasant of this class
of cathartics. It is a palatable solution, and is acceptable to almost any condition of the stomach. It produces a free watery movement from the bowels without pain if given as a purgative. In smaller doses the bowels may be kept in a
soluble or mildly relaxed condition. It is an antacid and refrigerant. The solution is dispensed in strong twelve-ounce bottles, the entire quantity being
necessary to produce thorough evacuation. As a laxative, the contents of
one bottle may be given in two, three or four doses.

CHAPTER VI.
Agents Acting as Direct Intestinal Astringents.

EPILOBIUM. coro. KINO.
RUBUS VILLOSUS. CATECHU.
EPILOBIUM. EPILOBIUM ANGUSTIFOLIUM.

Synonyms—Wickup, Willow herb.

Preparations—Extractum Epilobii Fluidum. Fluid Extract of Epilobium.
Dose, from five to sixty minims. Specific Medicine Epilobium. Dose, from
ten to sixty minims.

Physiological Action—The several species of epilobium are astringent,
tonic, emollient, and demulcent, and have a specific influence on the intestinal
mucous membrane. The epilobium palustre has a well established reputation as a remedy in intractable cases of camp dysentery and diarrhea, cases
having been cured by it when other means had fail

Specific Symptomatology—Chronic diarrhea with general emaciation,
and a persistent enfeebled condition with dry, dingy, rough, harsh skin. If
no great structural change, and no tubercular or cancerous conditions are present, this agent is the most satisfactory remedy we have. It is suggested where
the abdomen is contracted, and where the diarrhea is feculent in character
with sharp colicky pains.

Therapy—It will be curative also in general relaxed, subacute or acute
eases of diarrhea, after the stage of inflammation has passed, but is not as
reliable a remedy at that time as geranium.

In muco-enteritis it is of some service in conjunction with the indicated
remedies. It is very useful in the diarrhea of typhoid fever; it acts kindly
and surely. The author seldom uses any other astringent when these conditions are present. It exercises an apparent tonic influence upon the mucous
and glandular structures of the entire intestinal canal, overcoming ulceration, and being of material benefit in the more speedy restoration of normal
function.

In the treatment of chronic eczema, epilobium was strongly advocated
by one of our best physicians. He often gave it in conjunction with juglans.
In that class of inveterate cases that was at first papular and finally
squamous, he got excellent results. Dr. Goss had great faith in epilobium as
a skin remedy. He gave it in doses from fifteen to twenty minims, and in
persistent cases he would make an infusion of the herb, having the patient
drink it freely.

DIRECT INTESTINAL ASTRINGENTS 345
RUBUS.. RUBUS VILLOSUS.

Synonym—Blackberry.

ConstITUENTS—Villosin, tannin, gallic acid.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Rubi Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Rubus. Dose,
from ten to sixty minims.

Specific Medicine Rubus. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—The tonic and astringent properties of this
remedy are underestimated. It is an acceptable and prompt astringent in
diarrhoeas of infancy, where the evidences of relaxation and enfeeblement of
the mucous coats of the stomach and bowels are marked, and where there is deficient action of all glandular organs, especially of the liver, the patient being
pale, feeble, without appetite.

Therapy—In those cases of diarrhea where there are large, watery,
clay-colored discharges three or four times each day, an infusion of blackberry root will sometimes correct this entire train of symptoms. A syrup
of blackberry will also answer an excellent purpose.

COTO BARK.

Origin—The botanical source of coto bark is not certainly known, but
it is supposed to be obtained from a species of nectandra, a tree growing in

olivia.

ConstITUENTS—A volatile alkaloid, volatile oil, resin, starch, gum, sugar,
calcium oxalate, tannin, formic, butyric and acetic acids, cotoin, para-cotoin,
oxyleucotin, leucolin, hydrocotin, dibenzoylhydrocotin, peperonylic acid.

_,PREPARATIONS—Fluid Extract of Coto Bark. Dose, from five to twenty

Specific Symptomatology—Epidemic diarrhea, attacks occurring at
night suddenly, or in early morning stools frequent, ten to twenty in a few
hours; colliquative, rice-water stools, nausea and vomiting with great distress,
sharp, cutting pain in the bowels, involuntary evacuations, extreme prostration,
surface bathed in cold clammy perspiration, collapse, febrile reaction.

Therapy—It is a carminative, stimulant and astringent. It has a specific
effect on the alimentary canal but is not a suitable remedy where inflammation exists or is threatened, but rather should be employed in relaxed states,
and where some poisonous element has been taken into the system in the food
or drinking water. It is antiseptic or promotes asepsis.

It acts favorably in the diarrhea of typhoid fever, in colliquative diarrhea from whatever cause, in the diarrhea of consumptives and in atonic and
catarrhal diarrhea.

It possesses astringent properties and contracts the relaxed vessels. It is
one of our most efficient remedies in the exhaustive sweats of consumptive patients. It may be given in ten drop doses of the fluid extract, repeated according to the urgency of the case.:

The best results’ have been obtained from rather large doses, and it is a
good rule where relief does not follow the prescribed dose to increase it.

Dr. Edison of Indiana was quite enthusiastic on the action of coto. He
claimed that there was not only an astringent but a positive nerve sedative
influence from its action; that it controlled intestinal pain and soothed the
nervous system, and in one case he thought that its influence amounted to
a temporary paresis. The agent deserves further study.

CATECHU.: ACACIA CATECHU.

Synonym—Terra Japonica.

ConstiITUENTs—Catechu, tannic acid, ecatechin, quercetin, Catechu-red,
gum.
PREPARATIONS—Tinctura Catechu Composita. Compound Tincture of
Catechu. Dose, from ten to forty minims.

Therapy—A tonic astringent indicated in diarrheas where the discharges are serous, very watery in character—large fluid discharges, with
mucus. It will relieve intestinal hemorrhage, when the above diarrheas are
present, and the mucous membranes are relaxed, and out of tone. If combined with stimulant tonics or aromatics it is more serviceable. With special
uterine tonics, it will be found advantageous in menorrhagia.

KINO. PTEROCARPUS MARSUPIUM.

Part Employed—The juice dried without artificial heat.

ConstITUENTs—Pyrocatechin, kino-tanniec acid, kino-red, kinoin.

_,PREPARATIONS—Tinctura Kino, Tincture of Kino. Dose, from ten to sixty

Physiological Action—This agent produces a slight hardening and mild
discoloration of the unbroken skin. Its astringent influence upon mucous membranes is more pronounced. Upon raw surfaces it contracts tissues, checks the
flow of blood, coagulates albuminoids, and in some cases produces local irritation. It is positive and immediate in its action upon the mucous structures of
the gastro-intestinal tract, acting as a persistent tonic astringent. It is almost
entirely devoid of irritating properties.

Therapy—Kino is less used than formerly. It may be given whenever
there is excessive secretion or excretion. In inordinate night sweats, either
during convalescence from prostrating disease, or those of phthisis pulmonalis, it is a useful remedy. In the treatment of polyuria, kino is advised
as an active agent with which to control the excessive output of water. It
is also used in diabetes mellitus, and in protracted watery diarrheas without pain, characterized by relaxation and flabbiness of tissues, and general
feebleness. It may be prescribed in the diarrhea of typhoid, also, with good
results, especially if hemorrhage be present.

The powder may be blown into the nostrils in epistaxis, and it may be
dusted on ulcers and bleeding surfaces. An injection of a strong solution
is useful in leucorrhea and in other discharges either of a specific or nonspecific character. It is of some service in pharyngitis or in elongated uvula,
also in simple acute sore throats.

GASTROINTESTINAL ASTRINGENTS 347
CHAPTER VII.

Agents Acting as Gastro-intestinal Astringents with Marked Tonic Stimulant Properties.

GERANIUM. CAJUPUT. VERATRUM ALBUM.
QUERCUS. ABIES CANADENIS. GUAIACUM.
GERANIUM. GERANIUM MACULATUM.

Synonyms—Cranesbill, Crow Foot, Alumn Root.

ConstITuENTs—Tannic acid, gallic acid, red coloring matter, a resinoid.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Geranii Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Geranium.
Dose, from ten to sixty minims.

Specific Medicine Geranium. Dose, from one to ten minims.

Physiological Action—A tonic astringent, with alterative properties.
It influences the mucous structures, directly improving their tone and func.
tion, overcoming relaxation and debility with a marked improvement of the
capillary circulation.

From long experience, I have learned to esteem geranium more highly than
any other vegetable astringent, where a simple tonic astringent action is
needed. It is palatable, prompt, efficient, and invariable in its effects, and
entirely devoid of unpleasant influences.

Specific Symptomatology—Where there are relaxed, atonic or enfeebled
mucous membranes, in the absence of inflammatory action; debilitated conditions remaining after inflammation has subsided; excessive discharges of mucus,
serum or blood with these conditions, this agent is indicated.

Therapy—In sub-acute diarrhea geranium exercises an immediate influence, a single full dose producing a marked impression and improving the
tone of the entire gastro-intestinal tract from the first. In chronic diarrhea,
no matter how stubborn, it may be given with confidence if the specific conditions are present. In doses of ten drops every two hours, diarrheas of the
above described character will promptly subside. Active inflammation must
be subdued before the agent will act readily. It is the remedy for the general relaxation of the gastro-intestinal tract in childhood, with protracted
diarrhea. Any extreme activity, or hyper-activity of the liver, must be corrected, and this agent will usually do the rest. In catarrhal gastritis, where
there is profuse secretion with a tendency to ulceration, with, perhaps a mild
hemorrhage, this agent is very useful.

It has: been claimed that incipient gastric cancer has been cured with
geranium, and there is no doubt that it takes precedence over many other remedies, when a diagnosis between severe gastric ulcer and incipient cancer cannot be made without exploratory operation. Its range seems much wider
than that of a simple astringent, as it controls pain and rapidly improves the
general condition. Half of a dram may be given every three hours, but smaller
doses may do as well.

It has an influence over passive hemorrhage unlike that of other agents,
but in violent cases of recent origin it is not the best remedy. The author
treated a case of hematuria for nearly two years with absolutely no permanent impression upon the condition. Tubercular bacilli were found in abundance in the blood, which was usually arterial in character and steady in
quantity. All of the usual remedies were used. Finally fifteen drops of
geranium were given every two hours, and in two weeks the blood was absent
and had not returned at the end of three years, except mildly when the patient
persistently overworked. The patient improved slowly in general health and so
continued after several years.

Others of our writers refer to its use in phthisis pulmonalis, They claim
that all the symptoms are retarded by its use, and that it improves the general tone and overcomes night sweats. It may have a subtle influence
upon tubercular bacilli or the conditions induced by them, not understood,
which would account for its phenomenal action in the conditions referred to.

One physician gives geranium in chronic dysentery by enema. He uses
a dram in sufficient warm water, repeating it as often as necessary. If it induces colic, he adds a little colocynth to the enema. It does not check gastric
secretions, nor suspend peristalsis. It is a Positive tonic to the mucous linings of the entire intestinal tract, especially in colliquative diarrhea.

I used geranium in a case of cirrhosis of the liver with ulceration of the
duodenum, with fine results. The disease was held in check for many
months.

Dr. Davy treated a case of habitual menorrhagia with geranium associated with trillium. Of all concentrations, he would add one-half to one
grain to each dose rubbed up with a little sugar, three or four times a day
during the menstrual periods, continuing through the period in bad cases in
slightly increased doses.

QUERCUS. QUERCUS ALBA.

Synonym—White Oak.

ConstTITUENTS—Tannin, quercin.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Quercus Albe Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Quercus Alba. Dose, from a half to one dram.

Specific Medicine Quercus. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Therapy—The agent is of value in epidemic dysentery, acute and chronic
diarrhea, obstinate intermittents, pulmonary and laryngeal phthisis, tabes
mesenterica, great exhaustion of the vital powers from disease, profuse, exhausting night sweats, colliquative sweats in the advanced stages of adynamic
fevers, and debility, and severe diarrhea in sickly children, scrofula, gangrene, ulcerated sore throat, fetid, ill-conditioned and gangrenous ulcers, relaxed mucous membranes with profuse discharges, bronchorrhea, passive
hemorrhages, relaxed uxula and sore throat, spongy granulations, diabetes,
prolapsus ani, bleeding hemorrhoids, ‘eucorrhea, menorrhagia, hemoptysis.

Generally white oak bark is used locally, in decoction, for the general
purpose of an astringent, but it is also tonic and antiseptic, and possesses specific powers.

In severe epidemic dysentery, a strong decoction of white oak. bark, given
internally, in doses of a wineglassful every hour or two, the bowels being first
evacuated by a cathartic of castor oil and turpentine, has effected cures
where other treatment had proved of little or no avail.

In marasmus, cholera infantum, scrofula, and diseases attended with great
exhaustion, baths medicated with white oak bark, accompanied by brisk friction, have restored the waning powers of life.

When employed as a local application to ill-conditioned ulcers and gangrene, either a poultice of the ground bark, or cloths wet with the decoction
may be applied.

In pulmonary and laryngeal phthisis a very fine powder of the bark may
be inhaled.

I have depended upon a decoction of white oak bark one ounce to the
pint of boiling water, to which I have added after straining, a dram of boric
acid for all ulcerations of the mouth or throat, both in the early stages and in
many chronic cases. It is surprising how many simple early throat troubles this will abort, and how frequently it will prevent suppuration in tonsil-

litis. Combined with Yellow Dock, it has cured for me the severest cases of
nursing sore mouth that I have had, after other lauded remedies had signally
failed.

When the remedy is given internally in diarrhea and dysentery, it
should be combined with cinnamon or other astringent aromatic.

CAJUPUT. MELALEUCA CAJUPUTI.

Part Employed—The volatile oil. Solvent, alcohol. Dose, from two to
ten minims.

ConsTITUENTS—Cajeputene, iso-cajeputene, and para-cajeputene.

PREPARATIONS—Spiritus Cajuputi, Spirit of Cajuput. Dose, one fluid
dram. Mistura Cajuputi Composita, compound Cajuput Mixture. (Hunn’s
Life Drops.) Dose, from one to two fluid drams. Tinctura Camphore Composita, Compound Tincture of Camphor. Dose, twenty drops.

Therapy—It is used in the typhoid state, in the stage of collapse in Asiatic cholera, in exhaustion from cholera infantum, the typhoid condition in
malignant scarlet fever.

Oil of cajuput is a diffusible stimulant of great power, and is indicated in
all depressed and collapsed states of disease where there is no inflammation;
such as we find in the advanced stage of adynamic fevers and malignant diseases.

Cajuput is a vermifuge, and may be used to destroy intestinal worms.
It is antispasmodic, and is one of the most successful remedies ever employed
in the painful cramps of Asiatic cholera. It is equally efficient in cholera
morbus, cholera infantum, nervous vomiting, hysteria, and wherever there is
depression of the vital powers associated with spasmodic action.

It is important that there should be no inflammation present when cajuput is employed; and when it is given internally in such complaints as cholera
morbus, or spasms of the bowels, care should be taken not to excite inflammation of the stomach by a too free use of the remedy.

Its action is similar to prickly ash as a stimulant.

In the combinations known as Hunn’s Drops and the compound liniment
of camphor it has been employed.

In Asiatic cholera, oil of cajuput, in various combinations, was an established means of treatment among the older Eclectics. It stops the spasms,
overcomes the collapsed condition, and in many cases effects complete reaction. In like manner it controls the vomiting, cramps and diarrhea in cholera
morbus and allied diseases.

In acne rosacea, psoriasis and other scaly skin diseases the oil, undiluted,
should be applied to the diseased skin three times a day.

In toothache the oil should be applied to the cavity of the tooth on cotton.

In neuralgia the oil should be applied to the seat of pain.

In rheumatism, bruises, sprains, contusions, chilblaims, lameness, and
other painful affections, the compound tincture (liniment) of camphor, well
rubbed in before the fire, will be found to afford relief.

The oil of cajuput and its preparations may be given on sugar, or mixed
with honey, or in an emulsion, or in warm brandy and water.

ABIES. ABIES CANADENSIS.

Synonym—Hemlock spruce.

ConstITUENTS—Tannic acid, resin, volatile oil.

Canada pitch, or gum hemlock, is the prepared concrete juice of the pinus
canadensis. The juice exudes from the tree, and is collected by boiling the
bark in water, or boiling the hemlock knots, which are rich in resin. It is
composed of one or more resins, and a minute quantity of volatile oil. Canada
pitch of commerce is in reddish-brown, brittle masses, of a faint odor, and
slight taste.

Oil of hemlock is obtained by distilling the branches with water. It is a
volatile liquid, having a terebinthinate odor and taste.

PREPARATIONS—Canada Pitch Plaster, Tincture of the fresh hemlock
boughs, Tincture of the fresh inner bark.

Specific Medicine Pinus. Dose, from five to sixty minims.°

The hemlock spruce produces three medicines; the gum, used in the form
of a plaster as a rubifacient in rheumatism and kindred complaints; the volatile oil—oil of hemlock—or a tincture of the fresh boughs, used as a diuretic
in diseases of the urinary organs, and wherever a terebinthinate remedy is
indicated; and a tincture of the fresh inner bark, an astringent with specific
properties, used locally, and internally in catarrh.

Therapy—Gastric irritation and vomiting in cholera morbus, leucorrhea,
prolapsus uteri, chronic diarrhea and dysentery, irritation of the urinary organs, croup, rheumatism, eczema asthenic catarrhal conditions, with feeble
digestion, and pallid mucous membranes, profuse bronchial secretion.

A tincture from the fresh boughs, or the oil, is a diaphoretic and diuretic,
and may be employed internally, and as a medicated vapor bath in rheumatism, pleurisy, orchitis from mumps, peritonitis, and all inflammations caused
by cold. Internally it may be given in the gastric irritation of cholera morbus, and an irritation of the urinary organs. The oil, full strength, may be
applied with advantage to all sprains and bruises and to lumbago, rheumatism and sciatica, also in herpes, moist eczema, fevers and psoriasis. It is
also a good stimulating expectorant in chronic bronchitis and chronic coughs.

A tincture of the fresh inner bark of the hemlock may be employed in
obstinate leucorrhea, diluted with two parts of water, being applied to the
vagina on cotton, at intervals of several hours to secure a continuous effect.

VERATRUM ALBUM. WHITE HELLEBORE.

Synonyms—White Veratrum.

ConstTITUENTS—Jervine, pseudojervine, and protoveratrine.

PREPARATIONS—The dose of the powder, from one to eight grains. A preparation of thirty drops of the tincture in four ounces of water, may be given
Hy teaspoonful doses, to infants. Twenty drops of an ordinary tincture is the

ose.

Specific Symptomatology—Diarrhea with large watery discharges expelled with violence, spasmodic pains in the bowels, cramps, cramp colic, pain
producing prostration, with cold skin, cold sweat and sunken eyes.

Therapy”This remedy,in small doses frequently repeated is specific in
cholera infantum, cholera morbus, and in various forms of acute diarrhea.
It has some of the indications of arsenite of copper. It has been found
beneficial in Asiatic cholera. It is not in general use. It was at one time
given to act upon the skin and as an emetic. It is said to be found beneficial in some forms of nervous headache and in cases of mental derangement.

It has been long in use, to destroy lice, and as an insect powder.

GUAIACUM.. GUAIACUM OFFICINALE.

Synonyms—Guaiacum wood, Lignum vite, Lignum sanctum, Lignum
benedictum.

ConstTITUENTS—A resin and essential oil.

PrEPARATIONS—Tincture. The resin or gum guaiac. While we have described the wood and the tree from which the resin is obtained, the medicinal
principle is located in the gum from the wood, which is procured by natural
exudation. A wound in the bark of the tree will permit the exudation of the
juice. The gum can also be obtained from, the chips of the wood boiled in
salt and water. At other times large pieces of the wood are heated, the heat
causing the gum to exude. The gum is met with, in amorphous hard dense
masses, of varying sizes. It has a sweetish, faintly bitter taste, somewhat
acrid. It becomes tough when chewed and may be melted with a moderate
heat. When cold it may be readily reduced to powder. It is practically insoluble in water. The resin contains guaiacol, guaiacolum, kersol and protocate-chuic acid.

The dose of the powdered resin is from one to twenty grains. The dose
of the tincture is from one to four drams. The ammoniated tincture may be
given in doses of from ten to forty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—Inflamed tonsils, swollen, tumid and painful.
Painful deglutitions. Dribbling of saliva. Persistent dryness of the throat,
with difficulty in swallowing. Rheumatic dfficulty, accompanying tonsilitis.
Rheumatic dsease, accompanied with any soreness of the throat.

Therapy—This remedy is a most active astringent in full doses, and yet
in overdoses it acts as a cathartic. In medium doses it influences acute dysentery and diarrhea, and other relaxed conditions of the bowels. In very small
doses, from the one-twenty-fifth to the one-tenth of a grain of the resin, it is
said to cure some cases of habitual constipation, those depending upon extreme atonicity.

Prof. Locke says the remedy is not available when there is a high degree
of inflammation, with great vascular excitement.

The agent has long been used as a remedy for chronic rheumatism. It
seems to influence the elimination in a satisfactory manner. In rheumatic
sore throat and rheumatic pharyngitis, it is a good remedy. The indications
for rhus toxicodendron will often be found present with the indications for
this remedy. The remedy of old had a reputation in the cure of syphilis. It
has alterative properties and is useful in some cases of skin disease of a
chronic character, but we have superior remedies.

CINNAMON. ALUMEN. TANNIO ACID.
CAPSELLA. URTICA

ERIGERON. ERIGERON CANADENSE.

Synonym—Fleabane.
Constirvents—A bitter principle, tannin, volatile oil.
PREPARATIONS—Specific Erigeron. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Oleum Erigeronitis, Oil of Erigeron. This oil, which is obtained by distillation, is a pale-yellow liquid, with a peculiar aromatic odor and a pungent
aromatic taste. Soluble in an equal quantity of alcohol. Dose, from five to
ten minims.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent is given in post-partum hemorrhage,
abortion with alarming flow, menorrhagia with profuse flow of bright-red
blood, dysmenorrhea with blood clots, bloody lochia increased by movements,
epistaxis, hemoptysis, hematuria, hematemesis, bleeding from the socket of
an extracted tooth, incipient phthisis with bloody expectoration, local bleeding from wounds, bleeding from ulceration of the coats of arteries, hemorrhage from the bowels in typhoid fever—in all passive hemorrhages where
there is no fever or constitutional irritation.

Therapy—lIt is used also in diarrhea and dysentery with discharges of
bloody mucous after the bowels have been evacuated by a proper cathartic,
blood-specked and profuse watery discharges of cholera infantum, ecchymosis from injury, chronic gonorrhea with increased discharge of mucus, gleet,
leucorrhea, chronic dysentery, chronic diarrhea, uterine leucorrhea, catarrh
of the bladder, painful micturition, the urine being acrid, inflaming the parts,
gravel dysuria.

One doctor used the oil of erigeron in the treatment of leucorrhea. If the
patient was anemic, and plethoric, he would give iron in conjunction, five drops
four or five times a day on a square of loaf sugar. Others confirm the action of
erigeron in the treatment of albuminuria or Bright’s disease. They have found
it to reduce the quantity of albumin, lower vascular tension, control nausea,
headache, and other uremic symptoms.

The oil of erigeron may be diluted and employed as a gargle in sore throat
and tonsillitis, while it may be applied externally to the throat.

In chronic rheumatic inflammations of joints, and painful swellings, a liniment of oil of erigeron may be used with advantage.

Its action in promptly controlling uterine hemorrhage shows that it is
more than an astringent—that it contracts involuntary muscular fibre in the
uterus; in like manner it acts on the muscular coats of the bowels, on the
arteries and the capillary vessels, controlling hemorrhage and increased mucous discharges.

As an astringent it acts like turpentine, but it is much less irritating. It
is chiefly composed of terpene, a hydrocarbon which constitutes pure oil of
turpentine. In chronic phthisis and in chronic bronchitis with profuse secretion, it lessens the discharge, modifies the cough and gives tone to the respiratory mucous membrane.

In the treatment of goiter, especially in the early stage, the application
of oil of erigeron has been very beneficial. One-half of an ounce of the oil is
dissolved in one and one-half ounces of alcohol and painted freely over the
enlarged glands. If an occasional application of iodine is made with this
and phytolacca given internally, satisfactory results should be obtained.

An infusion, or dilution of the tincture in water, is effective as a local
application in ophthalmia after the acute stage, as an injection in gleet,
chronic gonorrhea, and locally in prolapsus uteri, prolapsus ani, and indolent
ulcers. In all these cases the remedy should be given internally for its specific
action,

In cytitis from calculous concretions in the bladder, it relieves the irritation, it also acts favorably in chronic nephritis and albuminuria, in chronic
cystitis and in chronic urethritis.

In flatulent colic and in the tympanites of typhoid fever it should be
given internally and by enema.

ASTRINGENTS WITH STYPTIC PROPERTIES 353

The volatile oil, the tincture, or the infusion may be employed; and the
dose, to be efficient, need not be large.

CINNAMON. CINNAMOMUM ZEYLANICUM.

Synonyms—Cinnamon bark, Ceylon cinnamon.

ConstITuENTs—Volatile oil, tannin, sugar, mannit, starch, mucilage.

PREPARATIONS—Tinctura cinnamomi, tincture of cinnamon. Dose, from
a half to two drams. Specific cinnamon. Dose, from ten to thirty minims.

Physiological Action—This agent has long been used as a carminative
and local gastric stimulant. It has a mild influence which is grateful and
soothing. It has been used to check nausea and vomiting and to relieve
flatulence.

Its rare properties have been overlooked by the profession and it has
been assigned to its exact position by the masses of the people. Midwives and
old nurses have long given a strong infusion of cinnamon to control postpartum hemorrhage, and it has been advised in ‘‘nose-bleed’’ and in flooding
during miscarriage and in menorrhagia. It has been useful in domestic practice, also in diarrhea and dysentery.

Therapy—Cinnamon, in the experience of the writer, is a hemostatic of
much power and is positively reliable in all passive hemorrhages. It is not.
advisable to combine it with the usual astringents, as ergot, geranium or
epilobium, but it acts in perfect harmony with erigeron and to a certain extent
with turpentine. German authorities claim that as soon as the menses or any
uterine hemorrhage becomes excessive and produces exhaustion or causes
alarm the decoction should be administered freely. It works to a better advantage in hemorrhage due to atonic conditions of the non-gravid womb, or
where there is muscular relaxation, or a general flaccid state of the womb
after delivery.

It certainly restores tone to the uterine muscular structure and induces
tonic contraction. It will also, Hale says, moderate hemorrhage not dependent on plethora, anemia or organic uterine disease. In some cases, during
labor, it promotes the normal labor pains and materially increases uterine
contraction, and prevents post-partum hemorrhage.

The writer, for nearly thirty-five years, has used an extemporaneous
prescription, which is his first resort in passive hemorrhage, if the stomach
is not seriously disordered. It is somewhat of an irritant to the stomach,
especially if full doses be given for a protracted period.

It is a superb case-remedy for emergencies.

It is made by combining a dram each of the oils of cinnamon and erigeron, and adding enough alcohol to make two ounces. Of this, from ten to
thirty drops on sugar, or dropped at once on water, will control nearly every
controllable passive hemorrhage. He has used it in all the uterine conditions
named above, in extreme pulmonary hemorrhage—persistent hemoptysis, in
the gastric and intestinal hemorrhages of alcoholics. In all forms of hematuria, especially in renal tuberculosis and in habitual nasal hemorrhage, in
many cases, a single dose accomplishes the object. As stated, it is not well
combined with ergot, but works harmoniously with ergot or gallic acid, if
given in alternation.

Two of our physicians at least advise the use of cinnamon in simple diabetes of a chronic character. Dr. Houts used it for himself after he had had
this disease for months, and found all the conditions improving.

CAPSELLA. CAPSELLA BURSA PASTORIS.

Synonym—Shepherd’s Purse.

ConstiTvents—Volatile oil, fixed oil, resin.

PREPARATIONS—Fluid Extract. Dose, from fifteen to sixty minims.

Tincture. Dose, from one to two drams.

Specific Medicine Capsella. Dose, from five to thirty drops.

Therapy—The agent has been noted for its influence in hematuria and
other mild forms of passive hemorrhage. It is of some benefit as a mild diuretic, soothing irritation of the renal or vesical organs. In cases of uncomplicated chronic menorrhagia it has accomplished permanent cures, especially
if the discharge be persistent and devoid of much color. The agent is also
useful where uric acid or insoluble phosphates or carbonates produce irritation of the urinary tract.

In the treatment of mild forms of intestinal hemorrhage or gastric hemorrhage from simple ulceration, the agent has been used with some benefit,
also in atonic dyspepsia, diarrhea, both acute and chronic, and in dysentery
and bleeding piles.

Externally the bruised herb has been applied to bruised and strained
parts, to rheumatic joints, and where there was ecchymosis or extravasations
within or beneath the skin.

Dr. Heinen of Toledo treats non-malignant abdominal tumors in women
with better results by adding five drops of capsella three times a day to the
other indicated treatment.

ALUMEN. ALUM.

Synonyms—Aluminum and potassium sulphate, alum, sulphate of aluminum and potassium.

Alumen Exsiccatum.
Synonyms—Dried alum, burnt alum.
Aluminum and Ammonium Sulphate.

Synonyms—Sulphate of aluminum and ammonium, ammonia, alum.

Physiological Action—Alum is actively astringent. It coagulates the
albumin in the tissues and in the blood, produces local contraction of the
capillaries, is somewhat escharotic, and produces induration of the skin and
tissues. It at first excites and subsequently diminishes the salivary secretion
and the secretions of the mucous surfaces of the mouth and stomach, diminishing the secretion of the gastric fluids, and precipitating pepsin. It produces constipation from the suppression of the intestinal secretion. In large
doses it has irritant properties which are in excess of its astringent properties, and may produce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach and intestinal
pains. The method of its action as an astringent is not well defined.

Therapy—By its local action it is used to control passive hemorrhage.
The powdered alum is thrown into the nostrils, or applied to a tooth cavity,
or to the open blood vessels in a bleeding wound. The solution has been introduced into the uterus to control post-partum hemorrhage, and solutions are
in common use for the treatment of passive uterine hemorrhage and leucorrhea.

URTICA. URTICA DIOICA.

Synonym—Nettle.

ConstiTuENTs—Formic acid, or a substance closely allied to it, volatile oil,
gum, starch, albumen, sugar, salts.

PrEPaRATIONS—Specific Urtica. Dose, from one to ten minims. Fluid
Extract Urtica Dioica. Dose, from one to twenty minims.

Therapy—Urtica has been employed for the general purposes of an astringent, both internally and externally, in hemorrhages, ill-conditioned ulcers,
and in chronic disease of th mucous membranes of the bronchi, bowels and
urinary organs, and it is generally agreed to be an efficient remedy. It, however, appears to have a dynamic action, as in post-partum hemorrhage, suppression of the milk in nursing women, retrocedent eruptions, urticaria, jaundice, dropsy, ague and corpulency its influence in small doses is reliable.

The fresh leaves have been used as a powerful revulsive in lethargy,
paralysis, intoxication, congestion of the brain, and hysterical insensibility.

From a half to one ounce of the expressed juice of the fresh plant has
been given at intervals of a few hours without untoward results.

In the treatment of eczema which includes the face, head and scalp, one
case was entirely cleansed and anointed with olive oil, leaving the oil on until
the crusts could be softened and removed. Specific urtica dioica was added,
two drams to an ounce of rosewater, and applied freely over the parts. The
cure was very prompt, especially when the condition of the stomach and intestinal tract was made normal.

This agent is also used when there is excessive mucous discharge from
the bowels, a drop or two at a dose. Persistent watery diarrheas are controlled by it.

ACHILLEA. ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM.

Synonym—Y arrow.

Constirvents—Achillein, volatile oil, tannin, achilleic acid.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Achillea. Dose, from five to sixty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—The following indications will guide in the
selection of this remedy: Hot, dry burning skin, at the beginning of acute
asthenic fevers, with suppressed secretion; deficient renal action, with vesical
renal or urethral irritation; acute or chronic Bright’s disease in its incipient
stage. Leucorrheea, with relaxed vaginal walls. Menorrhagia and amenorrhea; hemorrhoids, with bloody discharge, atonic gastric and intestinal dyspepsia; passive hemorrhages.

Of specific achillea the dose is from five to ten minims.

Therapy—While the profession has used yarrow but little, we find an
individual physician occasionally who depends upon it for some very important conditions. Dr. Lakin of England uses it in hematuria. He claims that
it is good in all forms of passive hemorrhage, whether of the lungs or of the
kidneys, or uterine hemorrhage. Yarrow is advised by Webster in uterine
hemorrhage. It is a mild astringent, probably acting also as a tonic. It is
useful in passive hemorrhage when not persistent in character.

It is a beneficial remedy in diseases of the mucous surfaces, relieving
irritation and profuse secretion. It soothes intestinal irritation and overcomes mild forms of diarrhea. It is of benefit in improving the tone of the
urinary apparatus, relieving irritation, overcoming strangury and suppression of the urine.

It acts best in strong infusion and its use must be persisted in. In general relaxed conditions it is a cure for leucorrhea, where there is a profuse
discharge, or thick, heavy mucus from enfeebled mucous membranes.

Dr. John Fearn, of Oakland, California, claims that it has but few superiors in its influence upon the skin. He says it has a stimulating action which
will be a revelation to those who have not used it. It causes the sudoriferous
glands to literally pour out their secretions, and with but little depression.

He claims that it will take the place of pilocarpine, with less unpleasant
results, and no danger. In fevers, he says, especially of the sthenic type, when
we desire to arouse the skin, nothing can surpass this remedy. The patient
is covered warmly in bed and a hot infusion of yarrow is given in frequent
doses. When the skin begins to soften the medicine is continued, but in less
doses. If there are evidences of autoinfection, from retained secretion, a
little capsicum can be added to the infusion. In cases of severe fever, in the

‘first stage, intermittent or bilious fever, it will cause the secretions to be
poured out so freely as to discolor the bed clothes.

A syrup made from the leaves relieves chronic cough, especially if there
be bloody sputum.

Where there is deficient kidney action, with evidence of uremic poisoning, with or without edema, this remedy is a very active eliminant. It will
take the place of a vapor bath, and that without exhaustion, the patient being
very comfortable all the while. It will abort fevers, reduce high temperatures,
in sthenic cases will relieve local and general congestion, will restore the
secretions, will open the sluce gates of the skin, and eliminate morbific materials.

It was one of the remedies which the ancients used in the healing of
wounds. Lakin quotes from an old volume, published in 1633, ‘‘The leaves
of yarrow do close wounds and keep them from inflammation or fiery swelling.
It stauncheth blood in any part of the body, and helpeth bloody flux. The
leaves put into the nose, relieve headache. It taketh away the pain of cholic.’’

Dr. Cole of Seattle has confirmed in a practical manner the action of
achillea on the skin. He has proved its action in indeterminate cases of incipient fever, where infecton is the cause, but the character is not determined.
Achillia and phytolacca he has used in tonsillitis. He has given it in dropsy
with good advantage. In old standing cases with organic disease, he has
used hair cap moss with it. He uses it in autotoxemia for its active elimination.

In acute epididymitis the temperature of 104 degrees, the condition was
controlled in twenty-four hours with achillea. When there is no abnormal
temperature, he believes that it has little but a diuretic action. Where there
is a temperature of 100 or above, he has never failed to get profuse diaphoresis without depression. He considers it a certain remedy.

ACIDUM GALLICUM.

Synonyms—Gallic acid, Trioxybenzoic, Dioxysalicylic acid.

Specific Symptomatology—This is specifically a remedy for passive hemorrhages, when the patient is greatly enfeebled, the functions of the body at
low ebb, the skin and extremities cold, with relaxation of the capillaries. It
has proved inthe writer’s hands an exceedingly valuable remedy in the
treatment of hematuria. I usually combine it with other indicated remedies.

Therapy—tIn acute Bright’s disease, where the patient is growing rapidly
worse, with a very large quantity of albumen in the urine, and where blood


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 350

ASTRINGENTS WITH STYPTIC PROPERTIES 357

is found persistently present, this agent has first place. In no case has it failed
to produce some beneficial results. Ten grains should be given in water every
one and a half or two hours, sometimes alternated with ten minims of the
tincture of the chloride of iron. The patient should be placed in bed and
kept comfortably warm, and fed with a very mild diet. The administration’
of large quantities of skimmed milk will aid the influence of the remedy.

In chronic Bright’s disease, where there is a small quantity of urine, with
a large quantity of white albumen precipitated, this agent will sometimes
restrain the excretion of the albumen. The writer has obtained no benefit
from it in those cases where there was but little albumen in the urine. In
passive hemorrhages from the stomach or intestinal canal, resulting from
chronic ulceration, good results are obtained from this remedy. Like geranium, it exercises a beneficial influence upon the stomach, as it does not interfere with the processes of digestion, but rather facilitates them. Where
there is pyrosis, or other excessive discharges from the stomach or from the
intestinal canal, it may be satisfactorily administered.

A number of writers claim to have obtained good results in the treatment of diabetes insipidus, or diabetes mellitus, but it is doubtful if it permanently influences these conditions.

The most satisfactory field of action of the remedy will be found, as we
have stated, in its influence upon the various forms of passive hemorrhage.
Externally tannic acid is a more active remedy than this, but internally administered this agent is in every way superior, as there is but little doubt
that tannic acid sustains a chemical change within the system and is changed
into gallic acid.

ACIDUM TANNICUM.

Synonyms—Tannic acid, Tannin, Gallotannic acid, Digallic acid.

PREPARATIONS—The powdered acid or the crystallized acid is administered
in doses of from three to ten grains.

Specific Symptomatology—Passive hemorrhages, relaxed conditions of
mucous membranes, which result in the free outpour of mucous; excessive
secretions from all organs, leucorrhea with much vaginal relaxation.

Therapy—tThe agent is not given commonly, where there is active inflammation present. It is not as commonly used at present as in the past. It was
freely given in non-irritative diarrhoeas, in the diarrhea of consumption, as
well as for the night sweats of that disease. It is given for all forms of chronic
hemorrhage, especially: passive hemorrhage. It was given in all cases of
catarrh where there was an excessive outpour of mucous. The chronic forms
of specific urethritis are still treated with it by many physicians. It has had
at one time a wide reputation in the treatment of Asiatic cholera. Sporadic
cholera is also treated by it.

Externally it is applied to excoriations, piles, fissure of the anus or rectum, prolapsed rectum and apthous ulceration of the mouth. It is commonly
used as an application to ulcerated and fissured nipples and to chronic ulceration in any location, chronic granular conjunctivitis, and ulceration of the
cornea, purulent conjunctivitis, with ophthalmia neonatorum.

This agent is an antidote to poisoning by mushrooms and poisonous
fungi and to strychnine poisoning.

For internal use, because of its ready and direct appropriation, gallic
acid is no doubt superior to tannic acid.

GROUP VI.

Agents Influencing the Character of the Blood.

Alteratives with Antiseptic Properties. _

ECHINACEA. BERBERIS. SCROPHULARIA.
BAPTISIA. DULCAMARA. ANACARDUM.
AILANTHUS. SARSAPARILLA, CASCARA.
ECHINACEA. ECHINACEA ANGUSTIFOLIA.

Synonym—Black Sampson, cone flower, purple cone flower.
Part EmPLoyYED—The root.

This plant grows throughout the central and western portions of the
United States, especially on the elevated tablelands, and in the northern portions, where it was known to the Indians as a cure for snake poison.

There is considerable confusion concerning the identity of the active
medicinal species of echinacea. The echinacea purpurea of the Eastern
States has been thought to be identical with the echinacea angustifolia of the
Western States. It is often used for the same purposes, but is universally
disappointing. King introduced it into his dispensatory as rudebeckia purpurea.

PREPARATIONS—Fluid Extract of the root, miscible with water without material precipitation. Dose, one-fourth to one-half fluid dram.

Specific Medicine Echinacea. Dose, five to forty or even sixty drops.

Echafolta is a purified, assayed form of Echinacea. The dosage of both
is the same. Externally or for surgical purposes it is advised as superior to
the other preparations of Echinacea. It is prescribed for the same conditions.

For from twenty to twenty-five years, Echinacea has been passing
through the stages of critical experimentation under the observation of several thousand physicians, and its remarkable properties are receiving positive
confirmation. As yet, but few disparaging statements have been made. All
who use it correctly fall quickly into line as enthusiasts in its praise; the
experience of the writer is similar to that of the rest, the results in nearly
all cases having been satisfactory. The laboratory observations have been
extensive but are not yet complete.

Physiological Action—The following laboratory observations of its acbs upon the blood were made by Victor von Unruh, M. D., of New York

ity:

More than one hundred blood counts were made in cases of infectious
diseases, mainly in tuberculosis. The results showed that echinacea increases
the phagocytic power of the leukocytes; it normalizes the percentage count
of the neutrophiles (Arneth count). Hyperleukocytosis and leukopenia are
directly improved by echinacea; the proportion of white to red cells is rendered normal; and the elimination of waste products is stimulated to a degree
which puts this drug in the first rank among all alteratives. The stimulation
toward phagocytosis become very evident in cases where it was impossible to


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 352

ANTISEPTIC ALTERATIVES 359

find any evidence of phagocytosis before echinacea was administered, and
where after the use of this drug for a period of only a few days the phagocytes were seen to contain as many as eight bacilli within the cell. In all cases
where the percentage count among the neutrophiles (polymorphonuclears)
has been such as give an unfavorable prognosis inasmuch as those neutrophiles containing one and two nuclei predominated over those containing
three, relatively and absolutely, the administration of echinacea for only two
weeks has normalized the percentage so as to give to the class containing
three nuclei the absolute and relative majority over those containing one
and two nuclei. Echinacea thus gives to the class normally strongest in phagocytosis the power where it obtains in the normal condition of the leukoeytes. ‘‘Subculoid Echinacea’’ was used for these experiments.

I have leng been assured from the observation of this remedy that it directly influences the opsonic index. I wrote von Unruh directly, asking him
for his opinion from his long experience and from his laboratory observations
of the action of this remedy. He replied as follows: ‘‘Quoting from McFarland’s Pathogenic Bacteria, the opsonic theory teaches that the leukocytes
are disinclined to take up bacteria unless they are prepared for phagocytosis
by contact with certain substances in the serum, that in some manner modify
them. This modifying substance is the opsonin. I have definitely demonstrated and am continuing to observe, that the action of echinacea on the
leukocytes is such that it will raise phagocytosis to its possible maximum.”’
The logical deduction, therefore, is that the opsonic index is correspondingly
raised by this agent.

When a half teaspoonful dose of the tincture is taken into the mouth, a
pungent warmth is at once experienced which increases to a tingling, and
remains for half an hour after the agent is ejected. It is similar to that of
aconite, but not so much solely of the nerve-end organs. The sensation is
partly of nerve tingling, and more from an apparent mild nerve irritant effect.
It much more resembles the action of xanthoxylum. If a small quantity be
swallowed undiluted, it produces an apparent constriction of the throat, sensation of irritation, and strangulation, much greater in some patients than in
others, and always disagreeable. The sensation persists for some minutes,
notwithstanding the throat is gargled, water is drunk, and the agent entirely
removed.

The toxie effect of this agent is manifested by reduction of temperature,
the frequency of the pulse is diminished, the mucous membrane becomes dry
and parched, accompanied with a prickly sensation; there is headache of a
bursting character, and a tendency to fainting is observed if the patient assumes an erect posture. After poisonous doses, these symptoms are more
intensified. The face and upper portion of the trunk are flushed, there is pain
throughout the body, which is more marked in the large articulations. There
is dimness of vision, intense thirst, gastric pains followed by vomiting and
watery diarrhea. No fatal case of poisoning is recorded, to our knowledge,
and only when given in extreme doses are any of the above undesirable influences observed.

The physiological effects are manifested by its action upon the blood, and
upon the mucous surfaces. The natural secretions are at first augmented, the
temperature is then lowered, the pulse is slowed, and the capillary circulation
restored. It exerts a peculiar affinity over local debilitated inflammatory conditions, attended with blood dyscrasis. It has its greatest field in adynamic
fevers, reducing the pulse and temperature and subduing delirium.

It promotes the flow of saliva in an active manner. The warmth and tingling extend down the esophagus to the stomach, but no further unpleasant
influence is observed. In a short time diaphoresis is observed, and the con-

tinuation of the remedy stimulates the kidneys to increased action. All of the
glandular organs seem to feel the stimulating influence, and their functional
activity is increased. The stomach is improved in its function, the bowels
operate better, and absorption, assimilation, and general nutrition are materially improved. It encourages secretion and excretion, preventing further
auto-intoxication, and quickly correcting the influence in the system of any
that has occurred. It stimulates retrograde metabolism, or tissue waste, more
markedly than any other single remedy known. It influences the entire lymphatic system, and the condition of the blood suggests that the patient has
been taking stimulants. Its influence upon the capillary circulation is not
comparable with that of any other known remedy, for while it is a stimulant
to the circulation in these vessels, it also seems to endow them with a certain
amount of recuperative power or formative force by which it is constituted,
not only a general stimulant and tonic to the circulation, but also peculiarly
so to local inflammations of a debilitating or depressing character.

liver and iron remedies in abundance. Sallow, pallid and dingy conditions
of the skin of the face quickly disappear, and the rosy hue of health is apparent. Angmic conditions improve with increased nerve tone. There are but
few subjective symptoms from large doses of this agent. It is apparently
non-toxic, and to any unpleasant extent non-irritant. The agent certainly
has a marked effect upon the nervous system, but its specific influence upon
the central organs has not yet been determined.

This agent is markedly anesthetic in its local influence. Applied to open
wounds and to painful swellings, while the alcohol may at first induce a burning sensation, this is quickly followed by entire relief from pain in many
cases. So marked is this influence that it could well be used for an antiseptic local anesthetic.

I am convinced that success in certain cases depends upon the fact that the
patient must have at times, a sufficiently large quantity of this remedy in order
to produce full antitoxic effects on the virulent infections. I would therefore
emphasize the statement which I have previously made that it is perfectly safe
to give echinacea in massive doses—from two drams to half an ounce every two
or three hours—for a time at least, when the system is overwhelmed with these
toxins. This applies to tetanus, anthrax, actinomycosis, pyemia, diphtheria,
hydrophobia, and meningitis.

Specific Symptomatology—It is the remedy for blood poisoning, if there
is one in the Materia Medica. Its field covers acute auto-infection, slow progressive blood taint, faults of the blood from imperfect elimination of all
possible character, and from the development of disease germs within the
blood. It acts equally well, whether the profound influence be exerted upon
the nervous system, as in puerperal sepsis, and uremia, or whether there is
prostration and exhaustion, as in pernicious malarial and septic fevers, or
whether its influence is shown by anemia, glandular ulceration or skin disease.

It is especially indicated where there is a tendency to gangrenous states
and sloughing of the soft tissues, throat dark and full, tongue full, with dirty,
dark-brown or black coat, in all cases where there are sepsis and zymosis.

It undoubtedly exercises a direct sedative influence over all of the fever
processes in typhoid, cerebro-spinal meningitis, malarial fevers, asthenic diphtheria, etc., for while it equalizes the circulation, it also acts as a sedative to
abnormal vascular excitement and lowers the temperature, if this be elevated,
while if this be subnormal, the singular effect upon the vital forces conspires
toward a restoration of the normal condition. As a sedative it is comparable
in some respects with baptisia, rhus and bryonia.

I think this sedative influence is largely exercised through its power to
destroy the germs of the infection, thus removing the cause.

ANTISEPTIC ALTERATIVES 361

Therapy—Echinacea is par excellence a corrector of any deprivation of
the body fluids. It influences those conditions included under the terms septic, fermentative and zymotic. Those which manifest themselves in a disturbed balance of the fluids, resulting in alterations of the tissues such as are
exhibited in boils, carbuncles, abcesses and cellular and glandular inflammations. These same conditions result from the introduction of the venom of
serpents and poisonous insects of every character, also from the introduction
of disease germs from pus and other putrid and infectious sources.

As an intestinal antiseptic the agent is bound to take first rank with all
physicians when once known. Experiments with it to determine its immediate influence upon the fevers caused by continued absorption of septic material, such as typhoid fever, puerperal fever, and the fever of the afterstages of diphtheria, show that its influence upon the pernicious germs begins at once.

In several cases reported, where special sedatives were not given,. the
temperature has declined from one-half to two degrees within a few hours
after its use was begun, and has not increased until the agent was discontinued.

It has then slowly increased toward the previous high point until the
remedy was again taken, when a decline was soon apparent.

It does not produce abrupt drops in the temperature, as often follows the
curetting of a septic womb, or as the removal of a quantity of septic material
often causes, but it effects an almost immediate stop in germ development, and
a steady restoration from its pernicious influence. In the treatment of typhoid
fever in the Cook County Hospital, Chicago, it was used in the Eclectic
wards for about two years, or more, and twenty-one days was the extreme
extent of the fever, and the mortality was the lowest known. In many cases
taken early, the fever was limited to fourteen days without delirium.

In private practice the reports of many physicians are much more enthusiastic, claiming that when given in the initial stage the fever has disappeared in seven days, and that fourteen days is the extreme limit.

The blood does not become impaired, the assimilation and nutrition are
remarkably increased, the nerve force is retained, elimination from all organs
is improved, ulceration of Peyer’s glands ceases, the enteric symptoms abate,
there is but little, if any, tympanites, and there has as yet been no case of
hemorrhage or perforation reported as having occurred after the agent was
begun. It certainly is a valuable acquisition to typhoid therapeutics. All
recent reports confirm these statements.

Its influence in septic fevers is the same as in typhoid. It seems to act as
a nerve stimulant upon the vital forces depressed by the poison. This fact
was especially true in a case where extreme septic absorption after a badly
conducted abortion caused acute nephritis and suppression of the urine.
Uremia supervened, with delirium and mild convulsions. Twenty drops of
the fluid extract of echinacea were given every two hours continuously..Extreme heat was applied over the kidneys, and a single dose of an antispasmodic was given, the echinacea alone being continued. The fever dropped
in two days, the mind cleared, the urinary secretion was restored, and the
patient made a rapid and uninterrupted recovery.

It is a most important remedy in uremic poisoning, and will supersede
all other single remedies.

It has been in constant use in diphtheria for three years. It is used locally
as well as internally. The exudates contract and disappear, the local evidences of septic absorption are gone, the fever declines, the vital forces increase, depression, mental and physical, disappears, and the improvement is
continual. In ulcerated sore throat of any character, in ulcerated sore mouth,

in stomatitis materni, in post-nasal or catarrhal ulcerations it is prompt and
effectual. It is preferred in these cases by those who use it.

In local inflammation of any portion of the intestinal tract, it has given
excellent satisfaction. It quickly overcomes local blood stasis, prevents or
cures ulceration, and retards pus formation by determining resolution. Reports of its use in appendicitis have been satisfactory, indeed. One writer
treated several cases of unmistakable diagnosis, and sastisfactory cure resulted.
The writer treated one marked case of appendicitis where pus formation and
future operation seemed inevitable. The improvement was apparent after
the agent had been taken in a few hours, and recovery was complete in twelve
days from attack.

Its use in cholera infantum has been satisfactory, especially if nervous
phenomena are present. The frequent discharges gradually cease, the patient is soothed and the nerve force increases as the fever abates. Extreme
nervous phenomena do not appear.

Webster, of San Francisco, in 1892, suggested the use of echinacea in
spinal meningitis. It should be especially valuable if any blood dyscrasia
lies at the bottom of the difficulty. Following Webster’s suggestions, other
physicians, from their personal observations, have been able to ascribe undoubted curative virtues to this agent in this and other convulsive and inflammatory disorders of the brain and cord. It directly antidotes the inection.

As a sedative in cerebro-spinal menengitis, Webster is disposed to believe
that it specifically influences the vascular area concerned in the nutrition of
the cerebro-spinal meninges.

Since the above was first written the use of echinacea for cerebro-spinal
meningitis has been established among those who have been experimenting
with the remedy in this disease. There is no doubt whatever that its influence in destroying the virus is specific, and effectual if given in sufficient
doses. Five drops is about the ordinary dose for a child, but even this can
be increased to twenty in extreme cases. It may be used in conjunction with
hexymethylenamine.

At the same time, it must not be forgotten that in all spasmodic diseases, depending upon infection both conditions must be treated together,
and gelsemium in full physiologic doses must be given with echinacea.

In the treatment of erysipelas it has given more than ordinary satisfaction, and has established itself permanently in that disorder. It is especially
needed when sloughing and tissue disintegration occur, its external influence being most reliable.

In the pain of mammary cancer and in the chronic inflammation of the
mammary gland, the result of badly treated puerperal mastitis, where the
part has become reddened and congested, the remedy has worked satisfactorily.

In bed sores, fever sores, and in chronic ulcerations it is exceedingly
useful. It is diluted and applied directly, while it is given internally. It is
of much value in old tibial ulcers, in chronic glandular indurationg, and in
scrofulous and syphilitic nodules and other specific skin disorders. The extract or the fluid extract can be combined with an ointment base such as
lanolin in the proportion of one part to one, two, or three parts of the base,
and freely applied. It can be injected into the sinuses of carbuncles, or into
the structure of the diseased parts with only good results.

Logan treated ten cases of stubborn skin disease of undoubted syphlitic
origin with this remedy alone. It was applied externally and given in full
doses internally, with a satisfactory cure in every case.

ANTISEPTIC ALTERATIVES 363

In the treatment of syphilis very many observations have been reported. It has been used entirely alone and also in conjunction with alterative syrups, but in no case yet reported has mercury been used with it.
The longest time of all cases yet reported, needed to perfect the cure, was
nine months.

The writer’s observations, in all cases he has treated, are that the patient begins to feel a general improved condition after taking the remedy a
few days. Some of them are enthusiastic concerning the sense of well-being
they experience. It begins by removing all the sensations of discomfort, and
the patient’s mind becomes hopeful and encouraged. The specific fever in
the first stages soon declines, and there is a permanent abatement of the evidences of the disease. There are absolutely no undesirable influences observed, and no after effects, and no undesirable side influences to overcome.
I have not, however, depended upon this agent alone, in all cases. There
are too many definite conditions present to be met with one remedy. I think
results are hastened by correct adjustments of three or four other vegetable
alteratives with this.

The influences of echinacea are not always enhanced by the use of the
iodides. On the other hand, I have had satisfactory results, where the
iodides, having previously been given in conjunction with it, were withdrawn, and the echinacea continued alone. The rapid amelioration of the
disorders of the skin, after the withdrawal of the iodides, was especially remarked if berberis was substituted for them.

The following most remarkable case occurred in my practice:

A gentleman, aged about forty-five years, in apparently good health,
was vaccinated, and as the result of supposed impure virus a most unusual
train of the symptoms supervened. His vitality began to wane, and he became so weak that he could not sit up. His hair came out, and a skin disease pronounced by experts to be psoriasis, appeared upon his extremities
first, and afterward upon his body. In the writer’s opinion, the condition
had but little resemblance to psoriasis. It seemed more like an acute development of leprosy than any other known condition.

This advanced rapidly, his nails began to fall off, he lost flesh, and a
violent iritis of the left eye developed and ulceration of the cornea in the
right set in, and for this difficulty he was referred to Prof. H. M. Martin,
President of the Chicago Ophthalmic College.

Dr. Martin gave him ten grains of the iodide of potassium three times
daily, and fed him freely upon phospho-albumin. The loss of hair was
stopped, but no other favorable results were obtained. The condition progressed rapidly towards an apparently fatal termination. At this juncture,
Dr. Martin asked the writer to see the case with him. It looked as if there
was no possible salvation for the patient, but as a dernier ressort, the writer
suggested Echinacea twenty drops every two hours, and the phospho-albumin to be continued. With this treatment, in from four to six weeks, the
patient regained his normal weight of more than one hundred and fifty
pounds and enjoyed afterward as good health as ever in his life.

Echinacea has been used with great success in aggravated and prolonged cases of rhus poisoning, both locally and internally.

The agent has been long in use among the Indians in the West as a
sure cure for snake bite. It has created a furor among the practitioners,
who have used it in the bites of poisonous animals, that has made the reports, apparently, too exaggerated to establish credulity on the part of the
inexperienced. Cases that seemed hopeless have rapidly improved after the
agent was applied and administered. There is at present no abatement in
the enthusiasm. One physician controlled the violent symptoms from the

bite of a tarantula, and quickly eliminated all trace of the poison with its
use.

Dr. Banta of California treated a man bitten by a scorpion, reported in
the Eclectic Medical Journal, with echinacea with rapid cure.

In a paper read at the Ohio State Eclectic Medical Society in 1895, Dr.
Gregory Smith stated that in 1871 Dr. H. C. F. Meyer commenced the use of
this remedy.

He says: ‘‘In malarial troubles it has no superior.’”? He also recommends it as a remedy for hemorrhoids; twenty-five drops of the pure tincture injected into the rectum three times a day promptly effect a cure. ‘It
is also prompt in stings from insects and in poisoning by contact with certain
plants.’’ As an antidote to the venom of the crotalus horridus it stands
without a peer. He gives the history of 613 cases of rattlesnake bite in men
and animals, all successfully treated. With the courage of his convictions
upon him he injected the venom of the crotalus into the first finger of his
left hand; the swelling was rapid and in six hours was up to the elbow. At
this time he took a dose of the remedy, bathed the part thoroughly, and laid
uown to pleasant dreams. On awakening in four hours the pain and swelling
were gone.

The fresh root scraped and given freely is the treatment used by the
Sioux Indians for snake bite. Recoveries from crotalus poisoning are effected in from two to twelve hours.

By far the most difficult reports to credit are those of the individuals
bitten by rabid animals; there are between twenty and thirty reports at the
present time. In no case has hydrophobia yet occurred, and this was the
only remedy used in many of the cases. In five or six cases, animals bitten
at the same time as the patient had developed rabies, and had even conveyed
it to other animals, and yet the patient showed no evidence of poisoning, if
the remedy was used at once. One case exhibited the developing symptoms
of hydrophobia before the agent was begun. They disappeared shortly
after treatment. In no case has an opportunity offered to try the remedy
after the symptoms were actually developed. One poorly nourished anemic
and jaundiced child was badly bitten and the treatment improved the general condition in a marked manner. In the treatment of hydrophobia, a case
is reported, which was bitten by a rabid animal out of a litter of six halfgrown pups, all of which showed signs of hydrophobia and were killed. A
number of parties were bitten by these pups. Two who were bitten died of
hydrophobia, three were treated at the Pasteur institute and cured, one was
treated with echinacea and cured.

The doctor prescribed teaspoonful doses of echafolta, every three hours.
The remedy was introduced on saturated gauze into the wounds, and covered all the injured surfaces. This was secured by a roller bandage. Prior
to the administration of the remedy the symptoms of nervous irritation and
incipient hydrophobia were strongly marked. These symptoms abated rapidly, and the patient recovered in a satisfactory manner.

A large amount of satisfactory evidence has accumulated confirmatory
of our statements concerning the curative action of the remedy in tetanus.
Dr. John Herring reported one marked cure. Dr. Lewis reports three cases,
where the remedy was injected into the wound after tetanic symptoms had
shown themselves. All the tissues surrounding the wound were filled with
the remedy by hypodermic injection and gauze saturated with a full strength
preparation was kept constantly applied. The agent was also administered
in half-dram doses internally, every two or three hours.

Another physician has reported the observation of quite a number of
cases, where tetanus had either markedly developed, or was anticipated.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 358

ANTISEPTIC ALTERATIVES 365

The use of the remedy satisfactorily overcame all apparent symptoms where
present, and where not present, no tetanic phenomena developed. In the
diagnosis of this disease the physician may confuse septic phenomena sometimes with those of developing tetanus, and the cure of the septic conditions
may have been taken for a cure of tetanus.

In the treatment of tetanus, I am confident that no antiseptic alone will
cover the entire pathology of this disease. There must be a powerful antispasmodic given in conjunction with the germ destroying agent, and vice
versa. Echinacea or phenol hypodermically, or both, with gelsemium, lobelia, or veratrum carefully selected and adjusted should meet the indications of all early cases.

These same facts should apply to cases bitten by dogs and wherever
convulsions result from infection.

The agent has had a most marvelous influence in overcoming pyemia.
We have had some extreme cases reported, where it would seem that the patient was positively beyond all help, where amelioration of the symptoms
was pronounced, and the restoration satisfactory.

In the treatment of small-pox conclusive proofs are now furnished us
which declare the remedy to be of great efficacy, not only in ameliorating all
the phenomena of the disease, but in preventing sequela. When applied to
the skin in a form of a lotion, the pustules are benign in their character, and
terminate with a minimum of scar.

In the treatment of erysipelas the remedy has proven itself all we anticipated for it.

Dr. Wilkenloh reports the treatment of at least five cases of goitre,
three of which had exophthalmic complications, and all were cured, with
this remedy alone. The doctor gave the remedy internally in full doses, and
injected from five to fifteen minims directly into the thyroid gland, and kept
gauze, saturated and applied externally. As no other remedy than this was
used, there could be no doubt about its positive influence.

Applied to painful surfaces, to local acute and painful inflammations of
the integument, or to painful wounds, its anesthetic influence is soon pronounced, and is of great benefit, in preserving freedom from pain during the
active healing processes, which are stimulated and encouraged by this remedy. Prof. Farnum is enthusiastic over the action of the remedy in overcoming the odor of cancer, whether in the early stages, or in the latter stage of
the development of this serious disease. He advises its persistent administration in all cases where there is a cancerous cachexia, believing that it retards the development of cancer and greatly prolongs the patient’s life.

We have already referred to its specific use in the treatment of phlegmenous swellings, old sores, dissecting and surgical wounds, and where
there are pus cavities of long standing. Also as a very positive remedy, applied to all cases where gangrene is anticipated, or has appeared.

Its influence in gangrene of the extremities has been very pronounced.
In gangrene of the fingers the curative benefits are observable from the first
application. It is useful in dermatitis venenata, in erysipelas with sloughing phagedena, and in phlegmasia alba dolens, or phlebitis. In this latter
condition its external use will greatly assist the internal medication.

In the treatment of Anthrax, echinacea has proven in a number of cases
to be an exceedingly reliable remedy. Dr. Lewis of Canton, Pa., first reported on it in 1907 in Ellingwood’s Therapeutist, and Dr. Aylesworth of
Collingwood, Canada, confirmed all of his statements, the observations of the
two doctors having been made about the same time, each without knowledge
of the other. In these cases, very large doses from one to two drams, frequently repeated, are required.

Twenty to forty minims of echinacea every two hours with proper local
treatment, such as iodine locally, will cure actinomycosis.

In the treatment of catarrh, it is used internally, and applied locally in
the form of a spray, if necessary. It is not only an important remedy in nasal
catarrh, but it is important in intestinal catarrh. I used it with excellent advantage in a so-called incurable case of ulcerative colitis with heavy discharge of mucus and pus.

Dr. Fair is emphatic in his statements that patients exposed to diphtheria should take echinacea in from ten to twenty drop doses every two
hours with the positive expectation of preventing the disease. If the first
symptoms appear as the usual premonitory evidences, the dose should be increased and other indicated remedies will ward off the disease. I have much
confidence in this statement and would suggest that it be carried out fully.

The use of echinacea in the treatment of impetigo contagiosa is confirmed. One doctor treated several very severe cases and the rational action
of the remedy suggests that its use externally and internally in this disease
will prove highly satisfactory.

Another physician whose name is not given treated infection and a
purulent discharge from the urethra where ‘there was urinary retention for
two days, with this remedy. He passed a catheter as far down as possible,
and then combined one part of echinacea with six parts of sterilized water.
He forced this slowly against the constriction. Relaxation took place probably from the local anesthetic influence of the remedy in a few minutes. The
catheter was withdrawn, and the water passed freely. He repeated the
treatment once or twice a day to a complete cure.

Dr. Rounseville reported to the Wisconsin State Medical Society that he
had used echinacea with excellent results in both diabetes mellitus, and diabetes insipidus, and also in some forms of albuminuria, and in each of the
cases he obtained results that confirmed his opinion that the agent was one
that would be a material assistance combined with other measures,

Stubborn diabetic ulcers have been treated by Dr. Thomas Owens very
successfully with the internal and external use of echinacea.

Dr. Hewitt used echinacea in alopecia. He made a strong solution and
combined with it agents that would assist in stimulating the nutritive functions of the hair follicles. He was well satisfied with the result.

A directly curative influence from this agent alone has been secured,
where from vaccination a gencral infection has been induced. I am confident that no other single medicine will accomplish as much in these cases,
immediately, and as satisfactorily as this remedy.

Dr. Hall of Clearwater, Neb., obtained the same results from injecting
the full strength remedy where there was renal hemorrhage with very painful piles. The curative effect was pronounced. Others agree with him in
the treatment of piles with echinacea. I am convinced that it would be good
practice to use collinsonia, hamemelis, or esculus in conjunction with this

Dr. Yates treated an eruptive disease with purulent discharge which we
call nettle rash with echinacea internally, and permangenate of potassium
solution externally. The results were exceedingly prompt.

Many cases of tibial ulcer treated with echinacea with curative results,
are reported. The agent is used both internally and externally, associated
often with other successful measures.

One doctor had an opportunity to observe the action of echinacea in
some fowl that had taken strychnine which was used to poison animals.

Those that received the medicine, lived. All those that did not get it, died’

This is simply a suggestion in favor of trying echinacea as an antidote for
strychnine poisoning.

BAPTISIA. BAPTISIA TINCTORIA.

Synonym—Wild indigo.

ConstiTveNts—Baptisin (a bitter glucoside), baptin (a purgative glucoside), baptitoxin (a poisonous alkaloid), resin, fixed oil.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Baptisie Alcoholicum, Alcoholic Extract of
Baptisia. Dose, from one to four grains.

Specific Medicine Baptisia. Dose, from one-fourth to ten minims.

Physiological Action—When fresh and taken in a sufficiently large
dose Baptisia causes violent vomiting and purging. In poisonous doses there
is an acceleration of respiration and reflex activity followed by death from
central paralytic asphyxia.

The agent has a bitter, somewhat acrid and astringent taste. In large
doses it is somewhat violent in its influence upon the gastro-intestinal tract,
producing increased intestinal secretion of the entire glandular apparatus.
It especially influences the liver. In overdoses it is emetic and cathartic, in
some cases causing an excessive flow of viscid saliva. It is laxative in small
doses, producing soft, unformed stools. It increases the biliary secretion,
sometimes most excessively. It exercises its influence more satisfactorily in
asthenic fevers than in sthenic fevers.

Specific Symptomatology—lIt is especially indicated where, with suppressed secretion and marked evidence of sepsis, there is ulceration of the
mucous membranes of the mouth, or intestinal ulceration.

In low fevers with dark or purplish mucous membranes of the mouth,
tongue dry and thin, with a dark coating, face dusky and suffused, circulation feeble.

Fyfe gives as its specific indications those much the same as were given
in the previous writing on this remedy—dusky discoloration of the tongue
and mucous membranes; full and purplish face, like one who has long been
exposed to the cold; protracted typhoid conditions, with continued moist,
pasty coating on the tongue; sleek tongue, looking much like raw beef; dark,
tar-like fetid discharges from the bowels—prune juice discharges; general
putrid secretions.

Dr. Fearn called attention to the indication of a dusky, purplish color
often distinctly marked in typhoid patients upon one side of the face. Ten
or fifteen drops of baptisia in water during twenty-four hours has corrected
that condition quickly for him, improving the patient.

The indications for baptisia are often present in infectious exanthema
such as smallpox or scarlet fever.

These indications resemble those also which call for acids. Selections
should be made between hydrochloric, nitric, hydrobromic, or hydriodic
acid, to be given in conjunction as required.

Therapy—With the above indications the agent has been widely used
for many years by our practitioners in the treatment of typhoid conditions,
and has established its position as an important remedy.

It has an apparent dynamic influence upon the glandular structure of
the intestinal canal, directly antagonizing disease influences here, and reenforcing the character of the blood, prevents the destruction of the red
corpuscles, and carries off waste material. In malignant tonsillitis and diphtheritic laryngitis it has been long used with excellent results. In phagedena
with gangrenous tendencies wherever located, it has exercised a markedly
curative influence.

It is useful in dysentery where there is offensive breath and fetid discharges of a dark prune juice character.

In scarlet fever, with its specific indications, it is a useful remedy.
Large doses are not necessary, but it should be employed early and the use
persisted in.

In the treatment of low fevers this agent is said to exercise marked
sedative power over the fever. Homeopathic physicians prescribe it to control the fever. There is no doubt that in proportion as the cause of the fever
is destroyed the temperature abates. An inhibitory influence directly upon
the heart and circulation cannot be attributed to it, yet it soothes cerebral
excitement to a certain extent, having a beneficial influence upon delirium.

It is advised in all diseases of the glandular system, and in hepatic derangements especially, with symptoms of this character. In the various
forms of stomatitis, putrid sore throat and scarlatina maligna; in inflammation of the bowels, where there is a tendency to typhoid conditions, especially
ulcerative inflammation of any of the internal organs; in dyspepsia, with
great irritability and offensive decomposition of food; in scrofula and in
cutaneous infections the agent should be long continued. In the long protracted and sluggish forms of fevers, with great depression of the vital
forces, in ulceration of the nipples or mammary glands, or of the cervix uteri,
it is spoken highly of..

AILANTHOUS. AILANTHUS GLANDULOSA.

Synonyms—Chinese Sumach, Tree of Heaven.

Administration—The powder is of greenish yellow color, strongly narcotic odor, nauseating, strongly bitter taste. The dose is from five to thirty

Specific Medicine ailanthus is prescribed twenty drops in four ounces
of water; a teaspoonful every hour or two hours.

The extract is given in doses of from one to five grains. The fluid extract in from five to twenty minims.

Physiological Action—In overdoses ailanthus causes vertigo, severe
headache, pains in the back and limbs, together with great prostration,
tingling and numbness; it reduces the pulse-beat and the respiration, and
causes great weakness, cold sweats and shivering. If it be given too frequently, or in too large doses, it causes death by paralyzing the respiratory
center, its influence resembling that of tobacco. It is said that both quassia
and gentian intensify its action, and that it should not be administered with
either iron or lead compounds.

The presence of ailanthus in a malarial locality, like eucalyptus, will
correct the malarial influence of that locality.

Specific Symptomatology—Its indications are similar to those of rhus
tox. It is a valuable agent, but its therapeutic influence is not fully determined. It is yet in the experimental stage to a certain extent.

It is indicated in cases in which all the evidences of sepsis are quite pronounced or prominent, such as a dusky eruption, dirty, dry, cracked tongue,
malignant sore throat and tonsils, with sordes on the teeth, and excoriating
discharges from the nose and mouth, bad respiration,'and adynamic persistence of disagreeable symptoms telling of blood-poison; in atonic conditions of the nerves, or of the mucous membranes of the body, or great general
weakness and prostration. It should be classed as an antiseptic, and in the
same class with baptisia, echinacea, etc.


<!-- chunk -->

ANTISEPTIC ALTERATIVES 369

 Therapy—It is of much service in scarlet fever, especially the malignant
form, in typhoid, and other types of low fever and in low forms of acute inflammation. With special reference to the action of ailanthus as a tonic to
the nervous system, it is efficient as a remedy in some cases of asthma as
well as in epilepsy, and in many cases of epileptiform contraction of the
muscles, ete. Frequently ailanthus will relieve nervous palpitations and
severe cases of singultus, that for a long time have withstood other remedies.
With the Chinese, a decoction of ailanthus is a most favored remedy in
tapeworm, dysentery and diarrhea. Because of its special tonic effect on
mucous membranes it is an excellent remedy in some cases of leucorrhea,
etc. For the same reason it has been highly praised as a remedy in many
dyspeptic troubles.

BERBERIS. BERBERIS AQUIFOLIUM.

Synonyms—Oregon grape, mountain grape.

ConstITvENts—Berberine, oxyacanthine, berbamine, tannin, fat, resin.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum berberidis aquifolii fluidum. Fluid extract of
berberis aquifolium. Dose, from five to twenty minims.

As istration—The active principle of the agent is apt to precipitate
if a combination is made with the iodide of potassium as is often done with
other vegetable alteratives. To avoid this the iodide solution should be
rendered slightly alkaline by adding a few drops of the liquor potasse before the combination is made.

Physiological Action—In overdoses in some cases the agent produces
tremor of the limbs, lack of muscular power, dullness of the mind, drowsiness and active diuresis. It is not a poisonous agent.

Its influence upon the secretion of the entire glandular structure of the
digestive and intestinal tract is steady, sure and permanent, although not
always as immediately marked as some other agents.

It stimulates all the glandular organs of the body. It stimulates digestion and absorption, and thus improves general nutrition. It materially
stimulates waste and repair.

John Aulde in 1911 advised this remedy for its immediate influence
upon the digestive apparatus, the blood, and the secretions. He said constipation is relieved and the bowel movements become regular and natural.
The complexion clears, the muscular strength increases, and the skin and
urinary organs become more active. I have found it indeed serviceable in
syphilis and in scrofula, the general indications being peculiar to indigestion
such as coated tongue, fetid breath, and a general feeling of malaise from
blood disorders. This is strictly in line with our own teachings.

There is a dynamic influence exercised by baptisia upon the entire
glandular structure of the body when adynamia is present, more particularly upon the intestinal glands. This influence directly reinforces the blood
in its effort to throw off the disease, and restore normal conditions. It is
because of this influence that it is of value in typhoid.

Dr. Hainey says that in whatever condition the patient complains of
difficult respiration, where the lungs feel compressed, where the patient
cannot lie down because of fear of suffocation if he sleeps, he has found baptisia in small doses every hour positively curative. He got this suggestion
from a Homeopathist, and he has proven it to be reliable.

Others have found typhoid cases with the characteristic symptoms
where the brain seems to be overwhelmed with toxines, where the patient
has times where the breathing is rapid or panting, alternated with slow res-

piration, in which this remedy is very prompt. The condition may also be
present in diphtheria, and in the so-called black measles or other highly infectious disorders.

Fyfe advises it in all diseases of the glandular system, and in hepatic
derangements especially, with symptoms of this character, in the various
forms of stomatitis, putrid sore throat and scarlatina maligna, and in inflammation of the bowels, where there is a tendency to typhoid conditions, especially ulcerative inflammation of any of the internal organs. In dyspepsia,
with great irritability and offensive decomposition of food. In scrofula and
in cutaneous infections the agent should be long continued. In the long protracted and sluggish forms of fevers, with great depression of the vital
forces, in ulceration of the nipples or mammary glands, or of the cervix
uteri, it is spoken highly of.

It will thus be seen that the agent is properly classed among the alteratives as its alterative properties stand first, but its pronounced tonic influence will be quickly observed. It overcomes weariness, ‘‘that tired feeling,’’
produces a sense of vigor and general improved tone and well-being.

Specific Symptomatology—The specific action of this agent is in scaly,
pustular and other skin diseases due to the disordered condition of the
blood. It is the most reliable alterative when the influence of the dyscrasia
is apparent in the skin. It is given freely during the treatment of skin diseases where an alterative is considered an essential part of the treatment.

Therapy—It has cured persistent acne for the writer when no local
treatment was used. It contributes to the removal of pimples and roughness
and promotes a clear complexion, a soft, smooth and naturally moist skin in
sensitive young ladies, when the cause is not a refiex one from ovarian or
aterine irritation, or menstrual irregularity.

It seems of especial value in scaly skin diseases and in disorders of a
non-inflammatory type, and yet it works nicely in some cases of the moist
variety..

It has cured very many cases of salt rheum even when the symptoms
were chronic in character and greatly exaggerated.

In moist eczema it has acted most satisfactorily, but has usually been
given in conjunction with other treatment. Dr. Soper, in 1884, reported in
the Therapeutic Gazette a most intractable case of moist eczema of an acute
character covering the entire body. No other alterative was given. The
case was cured in four weeks. In eczema capitis, eczema genitalis with
pruritus, and in scaly eczema of all kinds it has been given alone and has
acted promptly and surely.

It has cured chronic cases of scald head, so called, in a few weeks, restoring tone and vigor to the hair.

It has been often used in acne, and has worked nicely when local or reflex irritation was not the cause.

In psoriasis and in pityriasis it has won the praise of many doctors. For
dan it has been given internally and has produced cures in a number of

In many instances various forms of chronic dermatosis have yielded to
its influence when other treatment has failed.

It should be prescribed in glandular indurations and chronic ulcerations, both of a scrofulous and syphilitic type, giving excellent results in
these cases. It is lauded highly in syphilis, though it has seldom been given
alone in this condition, but usually with other vegetable alteratives, the
value of which, however, it has seemed to greatly enhance. Of this fact, I
am positively convinced because of the rapid disappearance of the eharacter-

istic eruption, and the marvellously smooth condition of the skin which has
followed with my patients when this agent is given in this disease.

When first introduced it was recommended in chronic malarial conditions, in intermittent fever, and in the stomach, liver, intestinal and general
glandular disorders of these conditions. It was claimed that its tonic influence was conspicuous in these conditions and that in certain cases it exercised marked antiperiodic properties. It certainly acts as a tonic and corrective to disorders of the liver, an influence that has been often remarked
when given for skin diseases.

DULCAMARA. SOLANUM DULCAMARA.

Synonyms—Bitter-sweet, woody nightshade.

ConstiTUENTs—Dulcamarin, solanine, gum, resin, wax.

PREPaRATIONS—Extractum Dulcamare Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Dulcamara. Dose, from half to one dram.

’ Specific Medicine Dulcamara. Dose, from one-half to ten minima.

Potatoes and tomatoes belong to this family, and although the fruit is
edible, the vines are usually poisonous.

Solanine may be obtained from the new sprouts of the ordinary potato.

Physiological Action—This agent is a powerful poison to all living protoplasm. It coagulates the blood and destroys the integrity of the
corpuscles.

Injected into the veins it causes dyspnea, thrombosis in the vessels and
arrest of respiration, Toxic doses produce tremors, muscular contractions,
central paralysis, collapse, coma, a violent fall of the temperature and death.

It is a narcotic, and in toxic doses causes nausea, vomiting, faintness,
pain in the joints, numbness of the limbs, dryness of the mouth, convulsive
movements, a small hard pulse, paralysis of the tongue, a purplish color of
the face and hands, twitching of the eyelids and lips, trembling of the
limbs, erythematous eruption, suppression of venereal desire, though recov:
ery has followed after very large doses. Clarus administered six grains of
solanine, which produced general cephalic distress, with occipital pain, increase of the frequency and loss of the force of the pulse, followed after
some hours by sudden vomiting, diarrhoea, great weakness, and marked
dyspnea.;

Therapy—Dulcamara is a remedy for all conditions resulting from suppression of secretion, from exposure to cold and dampness. It will restore
normal excretion and secretion.

In acute coryza, in bronchial and nasal catarrh, in lung congestion and
bronchial cough, with pain in the chest, all from cold, in bronchial asthma,
and in acute bronchitis it is an excellent auxiliary remedy.

In eruptive fevers it assists in determining the eruption to the surface,
especially if there is retrocession. It has a direct action upon the skin also,
being given in pustular eczemas and vesicular disorders quite freely. It has
produced good results in psoriasis, pityriasis, lepra, and other scaly skin disorders. It acts as an alterative in such cases, and will influence the skin derangements of scrofula and syphilis to a certain extent. It is available in
the various skin disorders of childhood from disordered blood and deranged
stomach.

It is an excellent alterative, if administered with care, and is therefore
valuable in syphilis, scrofula, and other blood disorders. In acute and
chronic rheumatism from exposure to dampness and cold, and in gout, it has
been advantageously used.

Nervous irritation with depression, with hyperesthesia of the organs,
and pruritus pudendi are relieved by it. It may be used in spermatorrhea
with undue excitement, priapism, nymphomania and satyriasis. It should be
given first in small doses, increased to full amount if necessary. In suppression of the menses with headache and nausea and acute ovarian congestion,
it will work well.

It is advised in the treatment of catarrh of the bladder, and as a stimulant to the urinary secretion.

SARSAPARILLA. SMILAX OFFICINALIS.

Synonyms—Jamaica, Honduras or Spanish Sarsaparilla.

ConstiTvents—Parillin, sarsa-saponin, saponin, volatile oil.

PrEPARATIONS—Extractum Sarsaparille Fluidum. Fluid Extract of Sarsaparilla. Dose, from one-half to one dram.

Extractum Sarsaparille Fluidum Compositum, Compound Fluid Extract
of Sarsaparilla. Dose, from one-half to one dram.

Therapy—This agent is an active eliminant, possessing diuretic and alterative properties to a marked degree. It has long been a popular remedy
for the treatment of blood dyscrasias, but is nearly always given in combination with other well known specific alteratives. In combination with potassium iodide, stillingia, corydalis, phytolacca, podophyllum, or other alteratives, it has been given in scrofula and secondary syphilis, and especially in
cutaneous diseases depending upon blood dyscrasia, and in rheumatic and
gouty conditions, with inactive kidneys irritated from the presence of large
quantities of uric acid and the urates. It is not at present in general use.

SOROPHULARIA. SCROPHULARIA NODOSA.

Synonyms—Carpenter’s square, Scrofula plant, Fig wort, Heal-all.

Constirvents—According to Prof. Lloyd, there is present an alkaloid, a
fixed oil, and a brown amorphous resin. From the alcoholic extract an amorPhous, yellow powder has been obtained, which has some of the properties of
digitalis.

PreparaTions—A fluid extract is prepared, and a tincture. Specific
scrofularia may be given in doses of from five to thirty drops.

Specific Symptomatology—Marked evidences of cachexia. Depraved
blood from any cause; glandular disorders of a chronic character, accompanied with disease of the skin. Ulcerations, eczema, excoriations from chronic
skin disease. Those cases in which there is a peculiar pinkish tint, or pink
and white tint to the complexion, with puffiness of the face, with full lips of
a pallid character, are benefited by this remedy.

_ Therapy—The agent is administered in that class of cases, with the indications named, where a pure blood alterative is demanded. Its influence is
perhaps more general than that of some of the better known remedies, but
demands more time in the accomplishment of its results.

In disase of the glandular organs, resulting in dyscrasia, in general
scrofula, in some cases of secondary syphilis, in depraved conditions of the
system, where dropsy follows, the remedy is demanded. Goss claimed that
it was especially curative where from blood dyscrasia, ulceration would readily follow contusions, or wounds would not heal readily. It has been used
to correct difficult menstruation and restore the lochial discharge. In the
form of an ointment, it is applied to glandular inflammations, especially

GLANDULAR ALTERATIVES 378

those of the mammary gland, and testicle, to bruises, ring worm, piles and
chronic, painful swellings or enlargements. The agent should have more
general use.

ANACARDIUM. ANACARDIUM OCCIDENTALE.

Synonyms—Cashew Nut.

ConstTITUENTS—It contains gallic acid and an acrid resin, anacardic
acid, and cardol.

ARATIONS—A tincture is prepared. The commonest form of administration is the Homeopathic mother tincture. Dose, from one-fourth of a
drop to a drop, four or five times a day.

Physiological Action—The juice of the rind is acrid, corrosive and irritating. Externally it produces blisters, which are apt to be troublesome and
difficult of cure. It produces redness, inflammation, swelling and deep ulceration.

Therapy—This remedy was first brought into use, in the treatment of
Senegal fever, a peculiar fever of the Tropics, where quinine has proved unavailing. Webster suggests that it may be found of value in the treatment
of mental disease, the result of nervous debility, especially that form known
as sexual neurasthenia, where there is loss of memory, threatened dementia,
failure of the will, great anxiety, and solicitation concerning the condition,
with general failure of the nervous power.

It has been used in the treatment of some forms of skin disease. There
is room for investigation concerning its action.

CASCARA AMARGA.

Cascara Amarga, sometimes known as Honduras Bark, is advised in
syphilis as an active alterative. The line of its action is where there is chronic
skin affection or where the pustular variety of the syphiloderm prevails, the
conditions being induced by debility, thus needing a specific tonic influence.
It soothes the stomach, overcomes sensitiveness or ready irritability of this
organ, increases the appetite, and improves general tonicity.

874 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Physiological Action—Though the young shoots of Phytolacca are used
as greens the mature plant is poisonous when taken in large doses. Death
has followed an overdose (one-half ounce) of the berries or root, preceded
by excessive vomiting and purging; drowsiness, prickling and tingling over
the whole body; vertigo, dimness of vision, cold skin, feeble pulse, great prostration, convulsions and coma.

While it is specific in its influence upon all glandulaf structures, of whatever character, it also is a blood-making remedy of great power, and it acts
directly also upon the skin. It influences the mammary glands and the testicles directly. The remedy acts also upon the spinal cord. It inhibits the influence of the medulla, to final paralysis. It slows the action of the heart,
reduces the force of the pulse, and lessens respiratory movements. In poisonous doses it will induce convulsions of a tetanic character. It is a drastic
cathartic and an emetic producing nausea of an extreme character. Its influence upon the bowels is greatly prolonged, and very irritating. It causes
great pain in the bowels, which is slow of relief. It reduces muscular power
and co-ordination. It produces dimness of vision, vertigo and drowsiness,
prolonged in some cases to coma.

Specific Symptomatology—The most direct action of this agent is in inflammation of glandular structures, especially of the lymphatic glands.
Pains of a rheumatic character from deficient catabolism are relieved by it.
It is directly indicated in irritation, inflammation and ulceration of mucous
membranes in rheumatic subjects, sanious ulcers, scabies, tinea capitis, sycosis, psoriasis, favus, noli me tangere, and all skin diseases. It is especially
valuable in the squamous variety of skin diseases.

Therapy—This agent must now have especial attention in its influence
in the treatment of acute inflammations of the throat. It makes but little
difference what forms of throat disease we have, from the simplest forms of
pharyngitis, through all the variations of tonsillitis, to the extreme forms of
diphtheria, this remedy may be given in conjunction with other indicated
agents. But few of our physicians neglect its administration in these cases,
and they are unitedly profuse in their praises of its influence. If there be an
infection of the local glands of the neck, from the throat disease, the agent
should be applied externally, as well as administered internally.

In the treatment of goitre there is a concensus of opinion concerning the
value of this remedy, but it is almost universally administered in these cases,
with other more direct remedies. Dr. J. V. Stevens is enthusiastic in his
opinion that adenitis needs no other remedy than phytolacca decandra.
Whatever the cause of the disease or of however long standing, he saturates
the system with this remedy, and persists in it, applies it externally and
claims to cure his cases. He has used it for many years with success. Others
combine other active alteratives as general conditions demand.

Too much cannot be said of its very positive and invariable influence in
the treatment of acute inflammations of the breast during or preceding lactation. It should be given every two hours at least in doses of perhaps ten
drops in extreme cases, or five drops in the incipiency of the disease, or mild
cases. Conjoined with aconite and applied also externally, we will find in
many cases no use for any other remedy. I have, however, found my results
to be more quickly obtained when an active eliminant is given in conjunction with the remedy, in mastitis. Two or three fifteen-grain doses of the
acetate of potassium will be found efficient. '

The writer has, through a long experience, gotten into the habit of adding this remedy to alterative compounds. This is especially true of those
prescribed for children’s glandular and skin disorders. It is an efficacious
remedy in any of the forms of skin disease, common to childhood. Given in

GLANDULAR ALTERATIVES 875

the incipiency of eczema and in some forms of chronic eczema, especially
that of a dry character, where there are cracks or fissures in the skin, these
promptly yield to the internal administration of this remedy.

It should be administered in the treatment of syphilitic disorders resulting in ulceration, and in the ulcerations of the outlets of the body. In varicose and other long-standing ulcers, in psoriasis, dermal abscesses, fissures,
boils and carbuncles it will be often found that a combination of phytolacca,
echinacea, berberis, and stillingia will prove signally effective.

Ten drops of equal parts of the juice of ripe poke berries and alcohol
may be given every thirty minutes in membranous and spasmodic croup
with great success, with other remedies as indicated.

In irritation of the urinary tract, even in conditions resembling Bright's
disease, with albumin, and abnormal deposits in the urine, it tends to relieve the irritation, and effect a cure.

Dr. Waska of Chicago is a strong advocate in the use of phytolacca and
echinacea in the treatment of any form of albuminuria. He believes with
proper auxiliary treatment, these two remedies will be of great service in
overcoming the excretion of albumin and in restoring a normal condition
of the kidneys. Skin disease of constitutional origin, and scrofulous skin
diseases, are cured by it.

Its action in relieving irritation, inflammation and ulceration of mucous
membranes in all parts of the body—throat, larynx, lungs, stomach, bowels
and rectum—suggests it as a remedy in inflammation of the lining membrane of the heart; and it is said to have cured cases of this kind.

In conjunctivitis, the local and internal use of the remedy is efficient;
and also in the treatment of chancre and bubo.

In the treatment of conjunctivitis, a saturated tincture of the fresh root
should be given in sufficient quantity to produce fullness of the temples and
head, while the eyes should be bathed frequently with the decoction.

In the treatment of ulcers and ulcerating skin diseases, the local application of a concentrated preparation of the root or berries should be made,
so as to exert something of a caustic effect, while full doses are given internally at the same time.

The presence in the blood of an infectuous irritant, which causes rheumatic pains, as in sciatic rheumatism, and irritation of mucous membranes,
or inflammation of the throat associated with rheumatic pains, and enlargement and ulceration of lymphatic glands from scrofula or syphilis, is an
indication for the remedial action of phytolacca.

It has been thought to stimulate the liver, by those who hold the theory
that rheumatism, peritonitis, tonsillitis, and the many diseases assigned to
the uric acid diathesis depend upon abnormal protoplasmic change in the
blood, as it circulates through the liver; but whether this be true or not,
there is no doubt that it improves nutrition.

Phytolacca is somewhat narcotic, and also a nerve stimulant in moderate doses, and this will explain its action in curing rheumatism, for those
who take the ground that this obscure disease is a neurosis; and also explains its action in neuralgia.

STILLINGIA. STILLINGIA SYLVATICA.
Constirvents—An acrid resin, volatile oil, stillingine, tannin, starch,

Preparations—Extractum Stillingie Fluidum. Fluid Extract of Stillingia. Dose, from ten to sixty minims. Specific Stillingia. Dose, from one to

sixty minims. Linimentum Stillingie Compositum, A. D., Syrupus Stillingie
Compositus, A. D., Oleum Stillingie, A. D.

Specific Symptomatology—Irritation of the mucous membranes of the
bronchial tubes, larynx, throat and both nasal cavities, deficient secretion,
membranes red and tumid or glistening, blood dyscrasia with general enfeeblement, skin diseases of a moist character, red and irritable.

Therapy—The application of this substance to the chest with the internal use of small doses of the tincture will be found of great benefit in bronchial cough where there is a sensation of tightness in the chest, where the
cough is hoarse and croupal without secretion. It has long been used in conjunction with lobelia in the treatment of croup.

As an alterative it has taken front rank with Eclectics for fifty years.
It is in general use in syphilis, in scrofula, in blood taint of any character,
in tubercular disease, and in the cancerous diathesis,

CORYDALIS. CORYDALIS FORMOSA.

Synonyms—Turkey corn, squirrel corn.

Const1Tvents—Corydalin, furmaric acid, bitter extractive, acrid resin,
starch, volatile oil.

PreparaTions—Corydalia (hydro-alcoholic extract). Dose, from onehalf to one grain.

Extractum Corydalis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Corydalis. Dose, from
half a dram to one dram.

Specific Medicine Corydalis. Dose, from five to forty minims.

Physiological Action—In overdoses it has produced biliousness, deranged
stomach, an excessive secretion of mucus, or catarrh of the stomach and intestinal canal, loss of appetite, indigestion, fetid breath, irregular bowels
and colic, with malaise and general indisposition to exertion.

This agent was in great repute among very many of our older physicians
as an alterative of special value. Tonic properties are so evident in it that
the patient’s vitality is increased while the metabolism of the system is influenced. In this particular it will operate in harmony with echinacea.
In some cases it acts well with berberis, hydrastis, and stillingia. In
syphilis, scrofula, and in all glandular derangements with general depravity
of the system, marked blood dyscrasia and general impairment of the nutritive functions, this agent is indicated.

Its influences are demanded in these cases more especially if there be
tumidity and enlargement or distention of the abdominal structures with
general atonicity, or in some cases in which there are persistently coated
tongue and fetid breath. This is often the condition in which a patient is
found following a protracted attack of intermittent fever—ague, and since
the entire glandular system has become sluggish from the disease the tonic
effects of this agent are here indicated. Its influence can be greatly heightened by the direct nerve tonics and calisaya in such cases as these.

Therapy—When blood dyscrasia is present, sluggishness of the digestive apparatus, deficient glandular secretion, impaired secretion of the mucous membranes of the stomach and intestinal canal, this agent is indicated,
as, in these cases, its tonic properties are plainly manifested.

It is of value in imperfect restoration of these functions after protracted
disease, on which it operates with the tonic and restorative stimulants to an
excellent advantage.

Amenorrhea, leucorrhea and dysmenorrhea, with relaxed condition of
the uterine supports and prolapsus, sometimes occurring from the extreme

debility following severe fevers, and common, also, with scrofula and other
blood dyscrasias, are all materially benefited by corydalis formosa.

In chronic skin disorders with marked cachexia, this agent is speedily
curative. It will be found superior to other agents in overcoming eczema
with great relaxation of tissue and general plethora.

It has been used in all cases of syphilis and scrofula with marked results.
In syphilitic nodules of the bones, in syphilitic and scrofulous ulcerations,
its influence is direct, immediate and permanent. If there is persistent ulceration with general breaking down of soft tissue, a strong infusion has been
applied externally with good results. This is in part due to its stimulating
influence upon the emunctories of the skin, facilitating elimination through
the glands of this structure.

It has a marked influence, also, upon the kidney function which, while
beneficial in its direct influence upon general elimination, is hardly sufficient
to enable it to be depended upon as curative of kidney or bladder troubles
to the exclusion of the use of more direct agents.

CHIMAPHILA. CHIMAPHILA UMBELLATA.

Synonym—Pipsissewa.

_ ConstrrvenTs—Chimaphilin, arbutin, ericalin, ursone, tannin, sugar, gum,
resin,
_PreparaTions—Extractum Chimaphile Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Chimaphila. Dose, from a half to two drams.

Specific Medicine Chimaphila. Dose, from five to sixty minims.

Syrupus Stillingie Compositus, Compound Syrup of Stillingia. Dose,
from one dram to one ounce.

Physiological Action—Chimaphila is an alterative, stimulating waste, a
tonic giving strength to the body, and a diuretic, removing dropsical accumulations. While it aids in restoring the excretory functions to a normal
condition, it tends to remove irritation of the urinary tract and kidneys,
lesions of the skin and lymphatic glands, and deterioration of the blood,
caused by the presence of waste products, the result of defective catabolism.

Therapy—Dr. Fox of New York recommended chimaphila in the treatment of glandular disorders. In 1905 he presented a very interesting paper
to the New York Society on the influence of this agent in the treatment of
general bubonic inflammation. He believes the remedy to be very valuable
in leucorrhewa, and diseases where there is an excessive outpour of mucus.
He gave it also when the abdomen seemed to be filled with nodules, when
there was diarrhea or cholera infantum.

He claimed that it will reduce the mammary glands if taken too long
by females, and in males it will reduce the size of the testicles. It does not
cause derangement of the stomach nor produce free action of the kidneys.

When the glands are large or inflamed either in the acute or chronic
form he believes that this remedy is superior to our other glandular remedies, even to phytolacca. With it he can determine whether an enlarged
gland is simple, or whether a tumor is developing. He gives it in bubo, ostitis, and mastitis with excellent results; also when the glands of the skin are
affected.

It can be correctly adjusted to the uric acid diathesis, in dropsy, with debility and loss of appetite. Also in cases where there are inflamed and ulcerated cervical glands, enlargement of the parotid glands from retained excrementitious products, dropsy after scarlatina and measles, dropsy with debil-

ity from any cause, chronic rheumatism, skin diseases with enlarged cervieal glands in scrofulous subjects, hectic fever with night sweats, enlargement of the mesenteric glands, also where there is an inflamed and swollen
prostate gland, with discharge of prostatic fluid, urine thick, ropy, with
loody sediment, itching and pain in the urethra and bladder, strangury,
chronic gonorrhea, chronic nephritis, urethritis with profuse and purulent
discharge, obstinate and ill-conditioned ulcers, in latter stages of typhoid
fever with deficient excretion, tumors of the mamme supposed to be cancerous, this agent is used.

In dropsy associated with debility and enlarged glands it should be
given freely.

In acute rheumatism a warm infusion should be given till it produces
perspiration, while hot fomentations of the same should be applied to the
swollen and painful joints.

In obstinate skin diseases in scrofulous subjects, the tincture from the
fresh leaves should be applied to the diseased skin and taken internally.

LAPPA. ARCTIUM LAPPA.

Tops.

Therapy—This agent closely resembles yellow dock in its action as an
alterative; it has a direct influence upon the blood, and thence upon diseases
of the skin and mucous membranes. Its influence upon the mucous membranes of the stomach encourages normal glandular secretion and promotes
digestion. In aphthous ulcerations of these membranes and in catarrhal ulcerations, it is excellent.

It influences the mucous membranes of the air passages when irritated
from any blood disorder, alleviating irritable coughs.

It cures psoriasis and chronic cutaneous eruptions.

It has a marked influence upon chronic glandular enlargements, and is
beneficial in syphilitic, scrofulous and gouty conditions.

It relieves irritation of the urinary apparatus, promoting a free flow of
the urine containing urea, uric acid, and a full quantity of excrete solids.

RUMEX. RUMEX CRISPUS.

Synonym—Yellow dock.

ConstiITvENTs—Chrysophanic acid, tannin, gum, starch. The petioles of
the leaves contain nearly one per cent of oxalic acid.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Rumicis Fluidum. Fluid Extract of Rumex.
Dose, from ten to sixty minims. Specific Rumex. Dose, from five to thirty

Therapy—tThe alterative properties of this agent are underestimated. It
is a renal depurant and general alterative of much value when ulceration of
mucous surfaces or disease of the skin results from impure blood. It acts
directly in its restorative influence, purifying the blood, removing morbific
material, and quickly cures the disease conditions. It is valuable in ulceraative stomatitis, in nursing sore mouth, and in ulceration of the stomach with

great lack of tone, combined with quercus or other tonic astringent, it has
no equal in these conditions. It has cured exceedingly persistent cases of
exhaustive morning diarrhea, the discharges being very frequent between
six and twelve o’clock. It has been used also in the treatment of syphilis
and scrofula with good results.

Dr. Vassar of Ohio believes that Yellow Dock is the best remedy known
to prevent the inroads made by cancer on the human system. It is also valuable in necrosis, scrofula, and tuberculosis. I have mentioned the fact that
this remedy will absorb iron from the soil very rapidly and carry a much
larger proportion than normal, thus rendering the iron organic. Dr. Vassar
knew of a blacksmith who raised Yellow Dock root, cultivating it in a soil
which he kept constantly saturated with the washing from his cooling tubs,
and scattered all the iron filings and rust over it. Ellingwood’s Therapeutist has often called attention to this property of yellow dock and to the positive tonic and alterative influence exercised by it when so saturated with
iron.

The above statement of the doctors is the only one I have been able to
find from any but foreign writers that emphasizes the power of yellow dock
in extracting iron from the soil. It is possible that other inorganic medicines
can be made organic in larger quantities by being artificially forced through
the growth and development of plants in the natural exercise of their vital
powers. The doctor thinks that the preservation of an absolutely normal
cell condition of the human body if possible will prevent the development
of cancer. He uses Yellow Dock hypodermically and thinks that there are
mild early cases of cancer that can be cured with this remedy alone.

MYRICA. MYRICA CERIFERA.

Synonyms—Bay Berry, Wax myrtle, Candle Berry, Wax berry.

PREPARATIONS—The powdered bark, from twenty to thirty grains. Of the
wax, one dram. Of the decoction of leaves or bark, from two to four ounces.
‘Tincture, from five to forty drops. Specific myrica, from two to twenty

Tops.

Specific Symptomatology—tThe agent is a stimulating astringent. It is
indicated when there is excessive mucous discharge, where catarrhal conditions exist in any locality, especially in the gastro-intestinal tract. Also
where atonic diarrhea, or persistent diarrhea, accompanies prostrating disease; also where there is feeble capillary circulation of the mucous membranes, accompanied with phlegmenous ulceration. Locally and internally
in sore mouth, with spongy, bleeding gums.

Therapy—It is a remedy for those conditions where the vital powers are
at low ebb. It aids the nutrition, stimulating the absorption of food, and
promotes the restoration of depraved blood. It is considered a valuable alterative. In any condition where the mucous surfaces have lost tone, and
are throwing out a profuse discharge, it may be given with advantage. It
has been found valuable in epidemic dysentery. In conjunction with capsicum, its stimulating and tonic properties are plainly apparent. ‘Combined
with geranium, it is of superior benefit, where the patients have taken mercury and where ptyalism has been induced. It assists in the more rapid
elimination of the mercury from the system. Combined with asclepias, it is
of much value in breaking up recent severe colds. Unlike most astringents,
it materially improves excretion, secretion and the functional action of the
glandular system.

In chronic stomatitis, of whatever form, where the breath is bad, and
there is slow ulceration, the mucous membranes being dark colored, this remedy in combination with other indicated remedies, will effect a rapid cure.
If the stomach is foul, and the breath and fecal discharges are offensive, it
should be given with an emetic, until the stomach is thoroughly evacuated.
In combination with sanguinaria, it will be found useful in removing abnormal growths from the post-nasal cavity. Sufficiently diluted, and combined

It is valuable in the treatment of very severe forms of measles and scarlet fever. It is especially useful in the persistent sore throat of scarlet fever
when the tissues are swollen and spongy. Given in conjunction with antispasmodics, it will improve the action of that class of remedies, in many
forms of convulsions.

Scudder claimed that the agent was a stimulant to the essential processes of digestion, blood-making and nutrition. The remedy may be given
to advantage to those patients who are afflicted with chronic malarial symptoms and jaundice, with imperfect liver action, who are troubled with headaches, which are worse in the morning. The tongue is coated yellow, there
is weakness and the patient complains of muscular soreness and aching in the
limbs. The pulse is slow, the temperature is inclined to be subnormal.

Therapy—The remedy is of value in the internal treatment of all diseases of the blood. Scrofula, syphilis, specific or non-specific glandular disease, and mercurial poisoning. It is used in ulcerations of the mucous membrane, due to depraved conditions. It may be given in diarrhea, dysentery,
the diarrhea of consumption, cholera infantum, and where there are longstanding hemorrhoids. It is also given in female disorders, attended with
fluent discharges, and in hematuria, also in dysuria and some forms of
passive hemorrhage. It would thus seem to possess marked astringent properties, as well as those of an alterative character. The older physicians ascribe an active influence to it, in the cure of the bites of venemous serpents,
spiders and poisonous insects. A simple but important influence is that exercised in tooth-ache. The juice on a piece of cotton applied to a tooth cavity, or to the sensitive pulp, has immediately controlled intractable cases of
toothache. It seems to exercise a sedative influence upon pain in the nerves
of the face, and relieves many cases of earache and tic-douloureux. In the
nocturnal incontinence of urine, in young children, accompanied with a large
flow of colorless urine, this agent has produced curative results in many

Plantago is of immediate benefit, Dr. Kinnett says, in the treatment of
snake bites. It should be made and given freely and a poultice of the leaves
applied to the wounds.

Plantago relieves inflammatory infection of the skin, especially if accompanied with burning pain or itching. Inflammation of the intestinal tract

which involves the mucous membranes and is accompanied with colicky
pains will be relieved by plantago.

Old Dr. Smith from southern Illinois applied plantago in a form of a
saturated tincture as a dressing for fresh cuts, wounds, or bruises. He could
thus secure healing without the formation of pus. He made his tincture of
the entire plant and roots, pounded up in alcohol. He applied one part
usually to four of water.

Where the teeth have developed sudden tenderness and seem to be too
long from ulceration of the roots, Dr. Turnbaugh gives plantago, ten drops
of a three x dilution every three hours. He gives the late Dr. E. M. Hale
credit for the formula.

Dr. Wallace dips a teaspoon into hot water, drops into this five drops
of the specific plantago, and pours this into the ear for earache, filling the
ear afterwards with cotton. He claims immediate relief in aggravated cases.

Externally the bruised leaves have been applied in the form of a poultice, to chronic ulcers, and skin disorders, resulting from depraved blood.
The juice may be combined in the form of an ointment. One physician told
the writer that he saw an Indian woman pound up a large quantity of Plaintain leaves, put them into a skillet, and pour on enough lard to cover. This
was boiled for some time, then strained. When cool, the product was a
smooth, greenish colored ointment. With this a chronic and previously absolutely intractable skin disease, similar to a dry form of eczema, was rapidly
and permanently cured. This ointment in appearance and action very
closely resembles the proprietary preparation, known as cuticura.

KALMIA. SENEGA, SYMPHITUM.
BLADDER WRACK. MANGIFERA, TELA.
COLCHICUM. MANACA. ICHYTHOL.
TRIFOLIUM.
KALMIA. KALMIA LATIFOLIA.

Synonym—Mountain laurel.

Constiruents—Andrometoxin, arbutin, tannin.

PrepaRaTion—Specific Kalmia. Dose, from one-half to five minims.

Physiological Action—In Kalmia we have a remedy acting in a manner
somewhat like veratrum viride, both in controlling fevers and in inflammations, as well as in its influence as an alterative, it having been successfully
used both in primary and secondary syphilis. Like veratrum it has also been
employed hypodermically in the treatment of neuralgia of the face, and
sciatica.

Therapy—Professor John King once reported the following case:

“‘Some time since I treated a case of syphilis of five weeks’ standing,
which had not received any kind of treatment during that period. The patient at the time I saw him had several chancres; the surface of the body and
head was covered with small red pimples, elevated above a jaundiced skin,
and he was in a very debilitated condition. I administered a saturated tincture of the leaves of Kalmia, and touched the chancre with tincture of muriate of iron, and effected a cure in four weeks, removing the jaundice at
the same time.’’

382 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Notwithstanding the authority, we accept this statement, cum grano
salis. If Kalmia would relieve other cases of syphilis as it did this one, we
may safely say that we have no other alterative in our materia medica equal
to it. It has not been extensively used, but it is without doubt beneficial in
glandular disorders, scrofula, and in mild cases of secondary syphilis.

Kalmia exercises a sedative influence over the heart, controls the pulse
beat without depression. It is markedly alterative but must not be pushed
because of this slowing influence. Homeopathists give it in cardiac hypertrophy, and for painful rheumatic affections, for facial neuralgia, for tobacco heart, and it will probably act well in rheumatic endocarditis.

It will be found of service in inflammatory diseases, also in hypertrophy
of the heart with palpitation, diarrhea and dysentery, rheumatism, chronic
inflammations, with atonicity, neuralgia, active hemorrhages, threatened
abortion from syphilitic taint, active menorrhagia, pain in the limbs and back
during menstruation, jaundice, and also in scleritis, with pain in turning the
eyes, and in ophthalmia.

BLADDER WRACK. FUCUS VESICULOSUS.

Synonyms—Sea wrack, Kelp-ware.

PREpaRaTIONS—Fluid Extract Bladder Wrack, miscible with water without precipitation. Dose, from one-half to four drams, three times a day.

Powdered Extract Bladder Wrack, of the same strength as the solid extract. Dose, from five to thirty grains.

Solid Extract Bladder Wrack; one part equals five of the plant. Dose,
from five to thirty grains. ‘

Therapy—This agent is used for the specific purpose of reducing unhealthy fat in excessive adiposity. If given in doses of from one-half to
two drams, three or four times daily, it has reduced excessively fat patients
in a satisfactory manner without interfering in any way with the normal
health functions. Wilhite, in New Preparations, 1878, gave his observations
as follows: ‘‘From our study of the drug we do not believe fucus to be a
reducer of the adipose tissue of healthy subjects. It is mostly on those cold,
torpid individuals with a cold, clammy skin, loose and flabby rolls of fat,
with relaxed pendulous abdomen, that fucus will display its powers to the
best advantage. In this class of cases fat is a morbid condition, a result of
" vitiated function. With such the remedy acts beneficially by overcoming
this torpid and morbid tendency, thus reducing the size by toning up the
vascular and sympathetic systems. Possibly it also acts upon the starchy
matters of the food in some manner, so as to prevent their easy change into
fat when introduced into the human economy.”’

It is in the obesity of individuals of the lymphatic temperament that the
beneficial effects of this drug are the most marked. It hag little or no influence in the reduction of the fleshiness of persons of active habits, or of
those of the sanguine temperament. In these cases strict regulation of the
diet affords the only prospects of relief, but owing to the keenness of the
appetite usually present, this regulation is rarely enforced. Fucus shows its
most decided influence upon women in whom there exist menstrual derangements, as menorrhagia and leucorrhea, owing to a general atonic and flabby
condition of the uterine tissues. In such cases an improvement in the local
derangements usually precedes the general reduction of fat and the improved tonicity of the general system.

Fucus is advised as a specific remedy in the treatment of both exophthalmic and simple goitre. It is especially successful in patients not above
thirty years of age. It is also suggested in the treatment of fatty degenera-

tion of the heart. It is of service in desquamative nephritis, and in irritation and inflammation of the bladder. When general muscular relaxation is
present, it is of service in the treatment of menstrual derangements.

COLCHICUM. COLCHICUM AUTUMNALE.

Synonym—Meadow saffron..

_Dose of the bulb, from two to eight grains; of the seed, from one to five

ConstTITUENTS—Colchicine, Colchicoresin, Beta-colchicoresin.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Colchicum. Dose, from one-fourth grain to
three grains. Extractum Colchici Semini Fluidum. Fluid Extract of Colchicum Seed. Dose, from one to five minims. Vinum Colchici Radicis.
Wine of Colchicum Root (when made from the fresh bulb). Dose, from one
to five minims. It should be discontinued as soon as violent catharsis or any
depressing effects are observed.

Physiological Action—Moderate doses cause some gastro-intestinal irritation, with loss of appetite, colic and diarrhea; if the quantity is increased
there is bilious vomiting, irritation of the colon with colicky pains, bloody
and mucous stools, but without tenderness on pressure over the abdomen;
while poisonous doses cause violent gastro-intestinal irritation, griping,
purging, vomiting, painful spasms of the limbs and trunk, collapse, delirium,
coma and death.

It is a cathartic and depressant of vital action, in large doses, an irritant poison inducing the phenomena of acute cholera, with enfeeblement of
the heart’s action and of the circulation.

Therapy—A recent Homeopathic writer, finds the indications for colchicum very often present in vomiting and the nausea of pregnancy. His
success has been so prompt and gratifying, that he seldom uses other remedies. It is indicated when there is a clear, glairy, stringy fluid vomited, the
nausea aggravated by smell of food.

In autumnal diarrhea, with white or bloody mucous discharges, the remedy gives immediate results.

The remedy is seldom used for its cathartic influence but has long been
given as a magical eliminative in chronic rheumatism and gout. It has a
specific influence upon muscular pains, acting in harmony with cimicifuga,
with which it is usually prescribed, and with gelsemium. It must be given
always short of its cathartic action; even then, when continued for some
time, it depresses the heart and the nervous system, producing a feeble pulse
and cool skin. It is seldom given in acute rheumatism, although it may be
prescribed advantageously in these cases,

In rheumatic carditis or pericarditis in its sthenic stage, its influence is
sometimes superior to that of any other agent. Its direct influence on the
disease processes is exercised to a most desirable extent.

TRIFOLIUM. TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE.

Synonym—Red clover.

Const1Tvents—Not analyzed.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Trifolium. Dose, from one to sixty minims.

Therapy—tTrifolium has-been used as a cancer remedy by virtue of
specific alterative properties said to exist in it. It was at one time widely
advertised, but the profession has failed to observe the effects claimed by


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 377

384 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

the proprietors, and yet it undoubtedly has active alterative properties. It
is given where a cancerous diathesis is known to be present, and its use is
persisted in for months. Improvement in objective phenomena is reported
from a number of excellent observers.

The agent is also prescribed in irritable conditions of the larynx and air
passages, especially if evidenced by spasmodic cough. It has served a good
purpose in whooping cough, in the cough of measles, and in general bronchial or pulmonary irritation. A dry, irritable cough will respond most
readily to its influence.

Dr. Lambert is of the opinion that trifolium has a direct action in improving the nutrition of the brain. He thinks it is demanded when the patient is overworked; when there is general mental failure, with loss of
memory of words, or when there is confusion of ideas of functional causes;
also when there is weakness of the lower extremities, or of the feet from deficient capillary circulation.

SENEGA. POLYGALA SENEGA.

Synonym—Seneca snakeroot.

ConstiITUENTS—Polygalic acid, polygalin, fixed oil, resin, volatile oil,
sugar, malates.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Senege Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Senega.
Dose, from ten to twenty minims. Specific Senega. Dose, from one to
twenty minims.

Physiological Action—Senega has sustained a reputation in the past, as
an antidote to the poison of venomous reptiles. It is an alterative of much
power, exercising a marked influence upon both the skin and mucous membranes, notably the latter. In large doses it produces nausea, vomiting and
catharsis.

It causes a sensation of acridity in the throat when a moderate dose is
swallowed, and may be employed in chronic pharyngitis, as a local stimulant,
where the mucous membrane is relaxed and the secretion abundant.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent is indicated in typhoid pneumonitis, capillary bronchitis, in aged and debilitated subjects, chronic bronchitis
with profuse secretion, in the declining stages of pneumonitis, bronchitis and
croup, when the inflammatory condition has passed off, chronic bronchitis
with paim and soreness in the chest and asthma.

Therapy—The agent is in use in the treatment of dropsy from obstruction and glandular enlargement, also in rheumatism, syphilis, squamous skin
diseases and in amenorrhea. In inflammation of the eyelids, and iritis it is
beneficial.

Senega has been employed as a stimulating expectorant in chronic
bronchitis, in aged and debilitated subjects, where a stimulating medicine is
demanded, and in the later stages of pneumonia and catarrhal inflammations.

In these cases, given in small doses, it improves secretion, removes abnormal deposits and restores the strength.

It is an energetic stimulant to the mucous membranes of the air passages; and, when given before the inflammation has subsided, aggravates the
cough and does harm. Given in small doses, it also acts as an alterative, and
may thus be given in dropsy from obstruction, in syphilis, and in squamous
skin diseases.

In the treatment of chronic asthma this is an efficient remedy.

MANGIFERA. MANGIFERA INDICA.

Synonyms—Mango.

Const1TvENTS—It contains a strong resin, tannin, and an acrid oil,
sugar and citric acid.

PrepaRaTions—There is a fluid extract, the dose of which is from fifteen
minims to one dram. Specific mangifera is also prepared. Dose, from one
to two minims.

Specific Symptomatology—Mangifera is especially adapted to atonic or
greatly relaxed mucous membranes with profuse discharge from marked
feebleness of the capillary circulation—very pale membranes with loss of
tone; also when there is diarrhea with large mucous discharges and dysentery with ‘an excessive mucous or mucopurulent discharge. The dose need
not exceed fifteen or twenty minims. It seems to have antiseptic properties
which are advantageous in malaria in septic trouble. It has distinct tonic
properties. It reduces the pain of dysmenorrhea, controls leucorrhea, reduces an exhaustive menstrual flow, and regulates this function. Prof.
Howe gave it when there was developing tumor of the uterus, expecting to
bia the abnormal growth. It is useful also in irregular, passive hem~
orrhage.

Therapy—This agent has something of the same influence that any
active tonic astringent would have combined with capsicum or other stimulant and an antiseptic. It seems to be a stimulating astringent tonic, correcting septic conditions. In malignant disease of the throat this author
has been in the habit of using sulphurous acid, and pinus canadensis, or
quercus. This remedy takes the place of both to an extent. It should be
applied to the fauces, should be gargled, and also used internally. It will
be found beneficial in ulceration of the mouth or other mucous surfaces. It
has been for some time recommended in the treatment of nasal catarrh, and
in vaginal leucorrhea, in bronchial catarrh also. It is specific to diarrheas
where there is a great degree of relaxation and lack of tone, and where a
stimulating astringent is needed.

Dr. Harrison gives magnifera freely in diphtheria and tonsillitis, two
drams in four ounces of water, a teaspoonful every half hour or hour, treating other indications with aconite, phytolacca, or jaborandi as required. He
used it in post-partum hemorrhage also. He says that when the mucous
membranes are red, tender, swollen, perhaps inflamed, and have a tendency
to throw out a discharge, then this remedy does the best good. It is a mucous membrane remedy.

Dr. Lisk used this remedy in the treatment of hematemesis with much
success.

In the uric acid diathesis, Dr. Rew gives mangifera in conjunction with
sulphuric acid in small doses every two or three hours with good results.

Dr. Barnes of Illinois reports several cases of severe uterine hemorrhage
both post-partum and during the menopause, cured with this remedy.

In syphilitic throat trouble, an advantage is gained by combining mangifera with thuja. In extreme cases, the ulceration should first be touched
with persulphate of iron; then thuja and mangifera used both to the ulcerations, and internally.

Dr. Jennie M. Covert reports extreme uterine engorgement and dysmenorrhea cured by mangifera and tiger lily. (Ellingwood’s Therapeutist
for September, 1910.)

Where there is mucopurulent discharge, either from the bowels or from
the uterus, Dr. Linquist says he knows no agent equal to it. The dose is
small, easily administered, has no disagreeable taste, it is acceptable to the

stomach, and more certain in its influence than most of the better known
astringents. In some cases where pain is present with these conditions
named, the pain seems to be relieved by the remedy. It has relieved the excessive albumen present in some cases of albuminuria, but has not seemed
to promote a cure on the few cases used. It may be applied directly to cervical ulceration, and excessive vaginal leucorrhewa, either of a specific or
nonspecific character, and will be productive of good results,

FRANCISCEA. FRANCISCEA UNIFLORA.

Synonyms—Manaca; Vegetable Mercury. ’

Dr. Williams of Bristol, Conn., has used manaca for twenty years. He
finds it especially valuable in chronic stiffness of the muscles. Where from
muscular contractions the joints are stiff. He does not think it curative in
actual arthritis. In one case, there was contraction of muscles of the
shoulders with inability to raise the arms, with severe neuralgic pain, weakness of the nervous system, and violent attacks of the heart. There were
rheumatic pains in the feet and lower part of the legs which prevented the
patient from walking except with the aid of a crutch. The patient was
anemic; had heavy urine full of uric acid. This patient was given melilotus
sticta and manaca. There was gradual improvement, and the patient ultimately made a satisfactory recovery.

Dr. Cowen gives manaca in fifteen-drop doses, with salicylate of sodium
in acute rheumas

Pee is a valuable remedy for gonorrhea and for gonorrheal rhenumatism.

Dr. Hopkins gives manaca in muscular rheumatism in four-drop doses
every two or three hours. He often combines it with macrotys. In either
case, the results are satisfactory.

SYMPHITUM. SYMPHITUM OFFICINALIS.

Synonym—Comfrey.

ConstiTvents—It contains tannic acid, starch and a small quantity of
asparagine.

PREPARATIONS—A tincture and a fluid extract are prepared, also specific
symphitum. Dose of tincture is from one to ten drops.

Therapy—Its direct influence, like other mucilaginous agents, seems to
be upon the mucous surfaces when taken internally. It was previously advised in all forms of bronchial irritation, with cough or difficult breathing,
especially if there was hemoptisis. It was used in the chronic cases, or where
there was protracted convalescence of severe acute cases. Some writers
have been very enthusiastic concerning its specific influence. One physician
who has used it for over thirty years, claims to obtain the best results from
a strong decoction, made from one ounce of the root, in a pint of water. He
gives this almost ad libitum as a drink. In pneumonia, this decoction relieves the difficult and painful breathing. It aids expectoration, and tends
to lower the temperature. In all serious cases, he depends upon this remedy.
Its properties he believes to be not only soothing, but demulcent, balsamic
and especially pectoral.

Where there is inflammation of the stomach or bowels, he has obtained
signal benefit from this infusion, especially if, as a result from inflammation,
there is hemorrhage or passive discharges of any character. He also gives
the infusion as a drink in nephritis, in both acute and chronic cases. In infiammation of the bowels, it may be injected, and being retained it exercises
a direct soothing influence, which would probably be enhanced by the addition of the proper intestinal antiseptic.

Old European writers called attention to this remedy as a vulnerary. It
had a great reputation as an external application in the treatment of
wounds, bruises and putrefying sores. They used it for ruptures and applied it where a bone was fractured, believing that it would stimulate the
knitting of the bone. These old writers claimed that it was useful in all
hurts and bruises, internal and external, in all cases of hemorrhage, blood
spitting, flux, diarrhea, dysentery, menorrhagias, leucorrhea. It will certainly relieve the swelling and pain of a bruise or sprain as quickly as any
other remedy with which we are familiar. One writer, in his zeal and confidence, says: ‘‘It acts upon an inflamed surface like a charm, subduing inflammation as water subdues and extinguishes fire.’’ Another writer says:
‘‘This agent has marvelous healing and cicatrizing properties. If the tincture be applied to swollen and painful parts, it quickly reduces the pain and
swelling. It stimulates granulation in slow healing ulcers, and rapidly promotes healing in bruises of the muscles, ecchymosis, injuries to the tendons,
and cartilaginous tissues. It is indeed efficacious. An antiseptic decoction
will produce much the same results as the tincture.’’

TELA ARANEAE.

The spider’s web has long been used as an astringent. The freshly spun
web free from dust, is macerated in alcohol, and a tincture is prepared, or
the specific tela, of which from one to ten "drops may be given as a dose.
The web has been applied directly to fresh wounds to check hemorrhage,
but because of the fact that it can seldom be found free from dust, it is not
commonly used. Given in intermittent fevers, it is said to produce a positive antiperiodic effect. It is also given in periodical headaches or neuralgias, for this purpose.

Specific Symptomatology—Felter and Lloyd give the following as its
indications: Masked periodical disease in hectic, broken-down patients. In
diseases that appear suddenly, with cool, clamy skin, and cool extremities,
cool perspiration. It has been given in delirium of continued fevers and
where there is great irritation of the nervous system or feeble heart under
these conditions. It will relieve restlessness and morbid wakefulness, when
feebleness is present and muscular cramps, also nocturnal orgasm, whether
in male or female.

ICHTHYOL.

Synonym—Ammonium Sulpho-Ichthyolate.

Therapy—tThe specific influence of the agent has not been determined.
It is an alterative agent for both external and internal use.

Hare recommends it highly in the treatment of acute articular rheumatism. He applies an ointment to the inflamed area which contains two
drams of ichthyol and twenty drops of the oil of citronella to an ounce of

adeps. This is applicable in severe sprains of the joints, and injuries of that
character. The agent is widely used, also, in chronic rheumatism and in
gouty conditions..

This same ointment is applied to erysipelas with equally good results in
all cases.

In lymphatic indurations and chronic scrofulous enlargements it is a
serviceable application; also in other glandular conditions with chronic enlargement. It is used extensively in the treatment of skin diseases,—ulcers
of various kinds, urticaria, acne, intertrigo, eczema and psoriasis. It has
been extolled in lupus, in epithelioma and in keloid also.

It is used to good advantage in chilblains, frost bites, burns, contusions,
and in slowly healing wounds.

A foreign physician employed ichthyol in eighteen cases of variola, only
two of which were fatal. From the time the papules appeared until the
pustules disappeared, a pomade was applied, made of one part of ichthyol to
two parts of lanolin, and six parts of the oil of sweet almonds. The results
were highly satisfactory.

Dr. Langford depends upon ichythol to control suppuration.

Dr. Courtright of Illinois used ichythol as a local application in eczema
and erysipelas. One patient with moist eczema covering almost the entire
body and limbs was finally radically cured by this substarce. He used it
with good results in scrotal eczema. In doses from one to ten minims it may
be given for cough and bronchial troubles with throat complications.

Astringent and Antiseptic Alteratives.

CALENDULA. CARDUUS.

HAMAMELIS. HAMAMELIS VIRGINICA.
Synonym—Witch-hazel..

Hamamelis. Dose, from ten to sixty minims.

Distilled Extract of Hamamelis. Dose, from ten to sixty minims.

Specific Medicine Hamamelis. Dose, from five to sixty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—Soreness of muscles, muscular aching, a
bruised sensation, soreness from violent muscular exertion, soreness from
bruises and strains, soreness and muscular aching from cold and exposure,
relaxed mucous membranes, dark blue membranes from venous stasis, veins
dilated, relaxed, enlarged, and full—varicosis.

Therapy—Internally it is given with the above indications as a remedy for sore throat of whatever kind, with feeling of extreme soreness, and
with dark-colored membranes.

It is used in tonsillitis and diphtheria, in phlegmonous ulcerations of the
mouth and throat, and in acute catarrh. If there is hemorrhage from the
post-nasal cavity, or from the teeth, or from spongy gums, it is a useful

It is valuable when there is excessive catarrhal discharge from dark,
relaxed mucous membranes, and in catarrhal or watery diarrhea with a
tendency to passive hemorrhage of dark blood.

It has conspicuous virtue in the treatment of hemorrhoids with the specific indications, The fluid extract in fifteen drop doses every two hours
will quickly effect a cure in recent cases, and will greatly benefit chronic
cases, its influence being greatly enhanced if combined with collinsonia. In
relaxation of the mucous membranes of the rectum and in prolapse of the
bowel, it is useful. In these cases the distilled extract should be applied
externally while the fluid extract is given internally.

It is a good remedy in relaxation of the vaginal walls with leucorrhea,
and in catarrh of the womb, also in passive hemorrhages from these parts,
especially if there be soreness or extreme tenderness. Externally the distilled extract is of first importance in soreness of the muscles, or aching of
parts. In bruises, sprains and muscular lameness its application gives
prompt relief. If applied hot it is particularly effectual. In the general
aching, lameness,and muscular soreness, following a severe confinement—a
source of extreme discomfort, often greatly retarding recovery—this agent
applied hot will give immediate relief, a measure it is cruel to neglect to advise, in these cases, as it acts at once. In lame and sore breasts it may be
applied, to immediately relieve the soreness, but other remedies should be
given for acute inflammatory action.

_ Its indications would suggest it as an excellent remedy in rheumatism,
being of value externally and in conjunction with other remedies.

Applied to burns and scalds it gives prompt relief. Ten grains of menthol dissolved in four ounces of the distilled extract applied to a burn will
stop the pain at once and will promote the healing. It is best applied by saturating a soft cloth with which the burned surface may be covered.


CALENDULA. CALENDULA OFFICINALIS.

Synonym—Marigold.

ConstiTvents—Calendula, volatile oil, amorphous bitter principle, gum,
sugar.

PrepaRaTions—Tinctura Calendule, Tincture of Calendula. Dose, from
half a dram to one dram. Specific Calendula. Dose, from one to sixty

Physiological Action—Through the cerebro-spinal vaso-motor nervous
system (Burt’s fourth edition Homeopathic Materia Medica), calendula has
one specific action. It induces paralysis in the arterial capillary vessels.
Through it the vaso-motor nerves become partially paralyzed and the vessels become loaded with blood. From this increased irritation which attracts
a large number of white corpuscles, the adhesive quality of these corpuscles
induces adhesive inflammation, as is beautifully shown in lacerated wounds
and cuts where calendula is used, producing union by first intention. Calendula is best applied in a cerate.

Therapy—This agent is used principally for its local influence. Internally it is given to assist its local action, and to prevent suppuration in cases
where there is a chronic. tendency to such action. It is useful in varicose
veins, chronic ulcers, capillary engorgement, and in hepatic and splenic
congestion.

As arnica is applied to bruises and sprains, this agent is also applicable;
and in addition it is of much service applied to recent wounds, cuts and open
sores. It is antiseptic, preventing the formation of pus. It causes the scar,
or cicatrix, to form without contraction of tissues, and in the simplest possible manner. It hastens the healing of wounds and materially favors union

390 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

of co-apted surfaces by first intention. It relieves the pain in wounds, and
if there are not bad bruises, it quickly relieves the soreness and favors the
healing process.

It is applicable to catarrhal mucous surfaces, to festering sores, local
swellings, glandular inflammations and to epithelioma and carcinoma to correct the fetor. It is especially applicable to severe burns, to promote healing and to prevent the formation of a contracting scar.

ZESCULUS. ZE8CULUS GLABRA.

Synonym—Buckeye.

ConstiTvents—A poisonous principle acting like nux vomica.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Ausculus. Dose, from one-tenth of a minim to
five minims.

Physiological Action—Atsculus Glabra acts on the cerebro-spinal system; and in toxic doses causes vertigo, vomiting, wryneck, opisthotonos,
tympanites, stupor, coma and death.

Therapy—Atsculus Glabra is a narcotic, but actively stimulates the nervous system somewhat like nux vomica. It has a special influence on the
capillary circulation of the rectum, and on the pelvic and portal circulations
and overcomes constipation and congestion associated with hemorrhoids,
and aids in the absorption of the coagulated blood in hemorrhoidal tumors
where a surgical operation is not deemed advisable. It lessens the caliber
of the capillary vessels, and removes obstructions to the pelvic circulation,
and is applicable whenever congestion results in hemorrhoids, or in enlargement of the uterus.

Concerning the application of this remedy for piles, Dr. Bloyer in The
Gleaner said the piles are usually large and purple. They rarely bleed.
There may be a sense of fullness in the rectum or there may be dryness with
stricture of the rectum, causing a proctitis, all of which is relieved by this
remedy as well also as the headache, backache and digestive or asthmatic
disturbances, which are reflexly induced.

In paralysis it is a stimulant similar to strychnine. As a narcotic it
acts similarly to opium but has much less narcotic power..

CARDUUS. CARDUUS MARIANUS.

Synonyms—St. Mary’s Thistle, Mary Thistle, Milk Thistle.

PREPARATIONS—A strong tincture; dose, from two to twenty drops.
The Homeopathic mother tincture, dose from one to twenty drops.

This remedy was spoken highly of by Rademacher, in hemorrhages,
where there was congestion of the liver or spleen. Where there was periodical biliary lithiasis. He employed the tincture of the seeds, in i
where there were caruncular growths, in the female urethra. He claimed it
to be of value in hemorrhoids, and in venis stasis. Carduus has been frequently advised in the treatment of varicosed veins. Its influence in this
line must be studied. This condition has been neglected by internists, they
having been taught that it was a surgical condition only.

Tripier used in it pelvic congestions, with quick and permanent _results. Its action has seemed to be similar to that of hamamelis and collinsonia. A case of chronic hematuria, with sensation of weight and tension in
the pelvis depending upon varicose conditions of the rectal veins, was
quickly relieved by it.

Specific Symptomatology—Felter and Lloyd say that its indications are
found in dull aching pain over the spleen, which passes up to the left scapula,
associated with pronounced debility and despondency, splenic pain, with no
enlargement or with enlargement, when there are no evidences of malaria.
Congestion of the liver, spleen and kidneys. General bilious conditions accompanied with stitches in the right side, with hard and tender spots, in this
locality, gall stone, jaundice, hepatic pain and swelling. Also in the vomiting of pregnancy when these organs are complicated.

As it overcomes congestion within the pelvis, it is useful in certain
forms of dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, or irregular passive uterine hemorhages.

Therapy—Harvey, in the California Medical Journal, says the indications are so plain that a tyro can prescribe it with certainty. It is indicated
where there is venous stasis, the true veins enlarged and clogged with blood.
This is true of either the large or small veins. He says he cured one case,
where the veins from the hips to the toes were as large and as hard and
twisted as Manila rope. They could be felt through the clothing. He cured
completely a varicose tumor in the popliteal space. It was about four inches
long, and three inches wide. The skin of the neck and hands was discolored.
There was a troublesome chronic cough with the expectoration of large quantities of offensive matter. He believed these symptoms to be associated with
disease of the spleen. He had observed these colored spots in other cases,
and sometimes found long continued soreness and tenderness of the joints of
the feet. Carduus, in five-drop doses three or four times a day, cured all
the symptoms in this case, restoring the patient to perfect health. The remedy acts slowly and must be persisted in.

CEANOTHUS. CEANOTHUS THRYSIFLORUS.

Synonyms—California Lilac, Deer Bush.

Therapy—Henderson has written a very interesting article which was
published in the Annual. He says he has employed an infusion of the leaves
in conjunctivitis, and as an application in inflamed eyes he has applied the
steeped leaves themselves. At one time he contracted a severe cold, which
caused hoarseness, burning pain and a dry constricted throat, with much difficulty in swallowing. He gathered some of the berries from this tree, and
eating them noticed a pleasant influence upon the throat and an ability to
swallow with less difficulty. He determined to try them in other cases of
throat disease, and had a tincture prepared from the berries.

Shortly after, in a severe epidemic of malignant diphtheria, he treated
eighteen cases without the loss of one, using the ceanothus in all cases. He
has used it since in diphtheria, pharyngitis, tonsilitis, and nasal catarrh, with
good results. He gives it in diseases of the mucous surface where the discharge is profuse, thick and tenacious. For a gargle he uses two drams of
the tincture to four ounces of water. It foams in the throat like the peroxide of hydrogen, and must be used with care. It removes all accumulations,
leaving the membranes clear and clean.

He has further employed the remedy in the treatment of subinvolution,
and evaporating it on a water bath, has made an ointment which is applied
to ulcers of the os uteri. It gives good results as a wash in the treatment of
gonorrhea, gleet, leucorrhea, and ulcers and old sores. He believes the berries should be gathered just before they are ripe, to obtain the best action.

LEMON. VERBASCUM. SARRACENIA.
CITRIC ACID. SAXIFRAGE, CALCIUM SULPHIDE.
THUJA. MELLILOTUS.

LEMON. LEMONIS SUCOUS.

Synonym—Lemon Juice. 2

Therapy—Because of the citric acid present in this substance it is exceedingly useful in therapeutics. The preservation of this juice from decomposition is easily accomplished by boiling, and pouring it while hot in bottles
with narrow necks. The neck of the bottle above the hot juice is filled with
sweet oil to the cork, which must fit tightly.

In Italy lemon juice is extensively used in malarial localities as an active
anti-malarial remedy. It has produced cures in many stubborn cases.

It is an active anti-scorbutic and is in common use on shipboard for the
prevention or cure of scurvy, for which it is of more service than citric acid.

ate has been used in some cases of chronic rheumatism and gout with good
r ts.

Diluted and sweetened it makes a most refreshing drink in fevers, especially if an acid is indicated, the mouth being dry and parched and the membranes of a dark color. It is useful in the hoarseness of singers and speakers
to temporarily clear the voice. It will serve a good purpose in irritably dry
coughs, added to cough syrups.

The pure juice has been injected into the cavity of the womb to control
intractable post-partum hemorrhage. It is also useful in other hemorrhages.

ACIDUM CITRICUM.

Synonym—Citric acid.

Therapy—This organic acid has a narrow but important field in therapeutics. It is specifically a remedy for scurvy. It is freely used by those
who are forced to subsist upon a salt meat diet, or are deprived to a great
extent of vegetable food. Much the same effects can be accomplished by the
free use of lemon juice, but it cannot be transported often in bulk and is
sometimes difficult of preservation. In general scorbutic conditions, the use
of citric acid in small quantity extended over considerable time is of much
service.

This agent is useful in rheumatism. It influences the secretion, excretion, and general elimination of uric acid to a limited extent. It is also useful as a drink in fevers in the manner described for mineral acids and tartaric acid. It is cooling, refreshing, allays thirst and stimulates the secretions
of the mucous and salivary glands, and temporarily promotes the normal
function of the stomach. It is an efficient organic acid with which to supply
the demand for acids in conditions where these are deficient.

There is a form of difficult breathing which is difficult to specify with
exactness, where a small crystal of citric acid placed directly on the tongue
and dissolved will give immediate relief. I have excellent authority for this
statement.

THUJA. THUJA OCCIDENTALIS.

Synonyms—<Arbor vite, white cedar.

Const1TvENTS—Colorless volatile oil, soluble in alcohol, with a sp. gr. 0.92,
and a yellow, crystallizable, bitter principle called thujin, punitannic
(Kowalier) and thujetic acid.

PREPARATIONS—Extract non-alcoholic, Fluid Extract Arbor Vite, not
miscible with water.

Dose, from one-fourth to one dram.

Specific Medicine Thuja. Dose, from one to ten drops.

Administration—In the treatment of local conditions involving blood
changes, the beginning dosage should be small, and administered two or
three times per day. If, however, the condition does not show improvement,
especially where there is a cancerous cachexia, the dose may be increased, if
necessary, to one dram every two or three hours. In non-malignant cases
the dose may be much smaller. In warts and excrescences, two small doses
per day will often remove them in a few days, especially if external use of
the agent be made also. In conditions of a syphilitic character the cure in
all cases will be more protracted.

Physiological Action—No extended systematic study of the physiological action or specific therapeutic application of this agent has been made.
It exercises a peculiar influence over abnormal growths and tissue degenerations, especially those of an epithelial character. It was originally advised
as a remedy for epithelioma, to be administered both internally and externally. It has been widely used in the treatment of cacoplastic growths, and
glandular indurations of a scrofulous character, also of warts, small tumors,
and incipient cancers of different varieties, and goitre. It is a remedy for
perverted glandular action and certain blood dyscrasias.

Therapy—It has been used extensively by all physicians in the treatment of cancer. It is claimed to exercise an abortive influence over incipient
cancer, and to retard the progress of more advanced cases. In extreme cases
it will remove the fetor, retard the growth, and materially prolong the life of
the patient. It should be given internally and the dosage increased to the
extreme limit. It should also be kept in contact with the parts externally
or injected into the structures. Epithelioma, condylomata, and all simple
cancerous growths should be treated with it.

I had an interesting report from Dr. Caple who injected thuja into a
giant-celled sarcoma of the hip joint. He used a teaspoonful in the structure at once, giving the remedy internally, in fifteen-drop doses, with the
same quantity of echinacea. The results were more than he had anticipated.

Dr. Jones injected from twenty to sixty drops of thuja into a rectal cancer every second day, and also where there was a cauliflower variety of cancer of the uterus. He believes in this remedy if enough is used. It must be
used very freely.

Thuja is given internally for cancer, and for the pains of cancer it is
applied externally, when possible, occasionally with good results.

Thuja certainly exercises a direct influence upon the glandular structures and function. In what manner this influence is exercised is unknown,
but in any disease that involves the gland, this remedy must be considered,
and if there are no contraindications it can be tried, and in many cases as
with the ductless glands, it seems to act in a direct manner.

Thuja is directly indicated, first, as a peculiar alterative, in improving
diathetie conditions of the blood. Again, it acts directly upon abnormal
growths—perversions, such as peculiar conditions of the cell structure of the
skin, and other external structures. It is thus indicated in all abnormal


<!-- chunk -->

growths of the skin or mucous membranes. It exercises a specific influence
upon catarrhal discharges, correcting the glandular faults that are to blame
for such a condition wherever they may be. It is specific to urinary irritation in aged people especially; also in childhood. It strengthens the sphincter of the bladder.

Dr. Andrews uses thuja in chronic diarrheas, and in the treatment of
ulceration of the bowels. In colonic ulceration, he uses it as a high anema
once or twice a day.

In a bad case of polyuria with great sensation of debility and weakness
of the entire sexual apparatus and some loss of sexual strength, a man of
65 was given five drops of thuja every two hours with complete success.

Thuja is an important remedy in the treatment of spermatorrhea, especially if from exhaustion from over-indulgence, or from masturbation. The
patient must avoid alcoholic stimulants. Dr H. C. Noble reported twentynine cures out of thirty consecutive cases. In these there was nervous irritation and usually sexual neurasthenia. In those cases in which the mind is
seriously depressed by the physical condition, it is of especial service, as it
stimulates the nerve forces and delays the discharge until, by general improvement of the entire nervous system, the condition is restored. The influence of the agent will be enhanced by a combination with avena sativa, saw
palmetto, or staphysagria, in cases of this character, when Thuja should be
given in doses of from two to ten drops, four or five times daily.

As an external application Thuja produces at first a sensation of smarting or tingling when applied to open sores or wounds and it is usually best
to dilute it with one, two or four parts of water, or to combine the non-alcoholic extract with an ointment base in the above proportion. This constitutes an excellent mildly antiseptic and actively stimulating dressing to indolent, phagedenic or gangrenous ulcers. It is of much service in bed sores
and in other open ulcers dependent upon local or general nerve exhaustion.

In chronic skin diseases of either a non-specific or specific character, it
is a useful remedy. Vegetations of all kinds, especially those upon mucous
surfaces, will yield to it readily. It is a useful agent in the treatment of
post-nasal catarrh, and nasal polypi. A small dose internally four or five
times daily, with the application of fluid hydrastis in a spray, will quickly
retard or remove such abnormal growths. It is also applicable to sloughing
wounds, and to phagedena of the venereal organs. It is a positive remedy
in the treatment of senile gangrene. It causes gangrenous surfaces to dry
without hemorrhage or other discharge, destroys offensive odors and influences granulation.

Recent reports have been made concerning the very beneficial action of
thuja on papilloma of the larynx and affections of that character in the post
nasal region. J. Moreau Brown has reported a number of cases satisfactorily
treated with this remedy. The agent is applied locally and small doses are
given internally. One cases of multiple papilloma was quickly cured.

The same writer uses this agent in the treatment of growths in the posterior nares. He reports the cure of several small tumors polypi and papillomatous growths. He treats chronic enlargement of the tonsils with this
remedy and has succeeded in reducing many severe cases to the normal size.
He has treated some cases of diseage of the turbinated bones with the same
remedy. He believes that in all cases of normal hypertrophy, where there
is no diathesis, underlying the difficulty, in the post nasal region, this remedy
is of inestimable value.

The treatment of adenoids is greatly simplified by making an application first of Monsell’s solution to the diseased structures, and then applying
thuja. The use of thuja persistently in these cases is as effectual as it is

when used in the same manner for syphilitic ulcerations. It may also be
given internally.

Professor A. J. Howe cured hydrocele almost exclusively with this agent.
The following is the course he adopted as described in his own words: ‘‘In
an ounce of warm sterilized water pour a dram of Lloyd’s Thuja. Mix thoroughly by drawing a quantity into the syringe, and forcing it back repeatedly for a few times, then draw up about two drams of the dilute mixture in the barrel of the syringe to be ready for use. Introduce a large
exploring needle into the sac of the tunica vaginalis testis and allow the
fluid to escape. Before withdrawing the needle, place the nozzle of the
loaded syringe into the needle’s open mouth and with a plunge of the piston
force the diluted Thuja into the cavity recently distended with serum. Then
in order to cause the liquid to enter every crevice of the sac of the hydrocele,
pinch and knead the scrotum with the fingers quite vigorously. The needle
is then withdrawn. The pain induced is quite considerale for at least half
an hour, then the patient goes about his business and usually no additional
treatment is required.’? The above method, with some unimportant variations, has been in general use among our physicians since suggested by Professor Howe, and the result as reported by very many has been satisfactory.

This agent has been used successfully in the treatment of trachoma. The
non-alcoholic preparation is combined with vaseline or other unctuous substance and applied once or twice daily.

Dr. Barber uses thuja in conjunctivitis. However severe the case, he
had no case especially where there was severe granulation of the lids that
were so stubborn but that he could benefit them with a mild solution of
thuja. He occasionally used Long’s thuja with vaseline with equally good
results. The use of thuja in pterygium is spoken of by a number of our writers. It is applied directly to the growth as often as possible without inducing inflammation. Cures have been effected in many cases.

Dr. Walker for many years has injected small tumors with thuja full
strength, twenty drops for the first injection, increasing the subsequent injection every day or two until in some cases he has used as high as half an
ounce. An abscess forms and the tumor slowly disappears.

The agent is especially advised in the treatment of urinary disorders
of the aged and young. It gives satisfaction in the treatment of nocturnal
eneuresis when the difficulty is of functional origin. It is also valuable when
there is dribbling of urine, loss of control from paralysis of the sphincter,
perhaps, in the aged, where urinary incontinence is present, with severe
coughs, lack of control when coughing or sneezing. Sometimes in severe
eases of nocturnal eneuresis, it is accompanied with belladonna, or rhus aromatica with good results. In old men with chronic prostatitis, with constant
dribbling of the urine, this agent is valuable. It relieves the weakness at
the neck of the bladder. It tones the muscular structure of the bladder and
exercises a desirable influence over the mucous structures of the entire urinary apparatus. It also stimulates secretion within the tubules of the kidneys by its direct influence upon the epithelial cells.

Where there is irritability of the bladder from the presence of uric acid,
or other precipitates in the urine, or where there is chronic rheumatism or
gout, the agent is serviceable. It is not advised where there is acute inflammation.

The agent is useful in urethral caruncle, and as a remedy for gleet, when
granular urethritis is present. The remedy is valuable in the treatment of
disorders of the mucous lining of the bronchial tubes. It is beneficial in
ulcerative forms of sore throat, where the secretions are fetid in character.
It may be inhaled in chronic bronchitis, bronchorrhea; bronchitis, with of-

fensive discharge; chronic nasal catarrh. Hemorrhage from these organs is
beneficially influenced by its use. A number of cases of spermatorrhea have
been cured since our previous report on this remedy.

The balanitis from cystitis with frequent urination, indicates this remedy. It is beneficial when the urine seems to burn or scald in the passing,
when there is local soreness in the urethra or neck of the bladder, when the
bladder tolerates but little urine at a time, and the patient must rise frequently during the night.

Homeopathists give thuja where the rectum is diseased; where there is
a slimy discharge streaked with blood with dark blotches on the adjoining
tissues; where there is itching and constant inclination without power to
expel feces; sharp sticking pains in the rectum. It will act with collinsonia
or hamamelis in this.

In cases of verucca on the genitalia or rectum, this agent is advantageously used, especially if preceded by a mild escarotic. In prolapsus of the
rectum, especially in cases depending upon paralysis, this agent may be diluted and injected. It has stimulating properties, which restore the vitality
of the part. It is good for fissure of the rectum with piles.

The injection of thuja into nevi that are of a non-pulsating character,
or those not too venous in structure, has been recently practiced.

In bulging nevus the remedy has been used advantageously. One case
was cured in three weeks, where the nevus looked like a ring worm, and was
of a fiery red color. One physician cured a case of ulcerated stomach with
thuja in four-drop doses, alternated with sub-nitrate of bismuth every two
hours. This patient had pain extending through the stomach to the back.
No physician gave him ease. Anything warm produced great distress. The
case was cured in a few weeks.

Another physician advised the agent in pruritus, whether of the anus or
vulva, especially when accompanied by fissures. He uses it in warts, tumors
and excrescences. He uses it for chapped and rough hands, so troublesome
in the spring and fall.

Another physician reports a case of extreme prolapsus of the bowel in
a child which he cured with a five per cent solution of thuja. A wet dressing
was applied and a small quantity of the remedy was injected into the bowel.
A greatly enlarged and relaxed uterus in a woman of fifty with severe
metrorrhagia was treated with injections of thuja. The remedy should be
diluted in these cases.

A doctor reports the cure of a urinary fistula by giving two drops of
thuja internally every four hours.

The use of the oil of thuja in confluent small-pox given internally and
applied externally was advised by Dr. Busbee who had an extensive and
successful experience with it in these cases.

Thuja applied to the tonsils and crowded into the crypts is an excellent
remedy, I am using it in syphilitic throat ulcerations and if I precede it
once or twice with an application of Monsel’s solution it has proved invariably satisfactory so far.

Thuja will prove an excellent remedy for all forms of sore mouth, especially if combined with echinacea and a mild antiseptic astringent.

Dr. Gibbs reports a case where a number of varicose enlargements about
the ankle of an old washer woman broke down. He made a 50 per cent solution of thuja and applied it freely with bandages, covering the whole with
roller bandages, and produced a cure.

VERBASCUM. “VERBASCUM THAPSUS.

Synonym—Mullein.

ConstITUENTS—Mucilage, volatile oil, fat, sugar.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Verbascum. Dose, from five to sixty minims.

A preparation may be prepared extemporaneously by breaking off the
upper portion of the blossoms of the mullein and putting them into a glass
jar and allowing them to stand in the sun for a few days. The mass is
then strained through muslin. The juice extracted by the above or other
process is called an oil or mulleined oil, but does not possess all the properties of an oil.

Therapy—tThe most direct use of this agent is in the treatment of simple
uncomplicated cases of deafness, or in the early stages of progressive deafness where the cause is not apparent. In these cases, from two to five drops
in the ear, three or four times each day, will stop the progress of the disease,
and will cure many simple cases. In its local influence, it softens and facilitates the removal of hardened secretions, stimulating the nerve structures
at the sarhe time. It has positive anodyne properties, and is curative in a
large number of the ordinary cases of earache in children, acting often more
quickly than other and better known agents, and is used with perfect safety,
as it has no irritating or toxic properties.

Used in the treatment of ulcerations of the ear, where there are fetid
discharges, it is of much value in allaying pain and promoting the action of
other antiseptic and healing remedies. In the treatment of the simple ear
troubles of childhood, it accomplishes alone that for which complex formule
are otherwise necessary.

Mulleined oil has a wider influence, however, than its use in the disease
of the ear. It has been used in rheumatic conditions to an extent, and I
am of the opinion that properly developed in this line, it will be found a
serviceable remedy. Internally, the specific medicine or the infusion exereises a diaphoretic and diuretic influence, and is soothing to the nervous
system.

This agent is often used in irritation and inflammation of the
apparatus, acting in harmony with hydrangia, gelsemium or other antispasmodics in stricture from irritation. It is useful also in acute catarrh, either
of a specific or non-specific origin, in catarrhal cystitis, and in some cases
of pyelitis and catarrhal nephritis. It has been used also in bronchial irritation and in asthmatic bronchitis. In uncomplicated asthma, especially the
paroxysmal form, mullein leaves, mixed with stramonium and potassium nitrate and smoked through a pipe, will often give prompt relief. The smoking must be suspended if vertigo supervenes.

The agent has long been a domestic remedy in the treatment of rheumatism. A fomentation is prepared from the leaves or the steam from a decoction is confined to the part, or compresses are wrung from a strong infusion
of the leaves, and applied.

One-half drop doses of the mulleined oil four times a day has overcome
some dribbling of the urine. This remedy seems to be serviceable as an external application to inflamed glands.

Dr. Mathews says that this is an excellent agent in the treatment of
conditions where there is persistent acridity of the urine, especially if it
produces pain or strangury.

Verbascum is useful for the treatment of orchitis. It can be used internally and externally.

SAXIFRAGE. SAXIFRAGA PENNSYLVANICA.

Synonyms—Tall Saxifrage, kings’ evil root, scrofula bush.

Specific Symptomatology—It is specific as an alterative in syphilitic affections of the eyes. In glaucoma, in iritis, in ophthalmia, in cataract from
syphilitic causes, our doctors have had the most marked results from the
use of this remedy. Dose, F. V. Ext., from 20 drops to one dram.

The agent is an active diuretic and an excellent tonic, as well as possessing an active alterative or antiscorbutic properties.

MELILOTUS. MELILOTUS OFFICINALIS ALBA.

Synonym—Sweet clover.

ConstitveNts—Coumarin, melilotie acid, coumaric acid.

PrepaRATION—Emplastrum Meliloti, Melilot plaster.

Specific Melilotus. Dose, from one to ten drops.

Specific Symptomatology—Spasms, colic, dysuria, dysmenorrhea; in
painful cough, spasms from dentition, pain in the stomach, rectum, or uterus,
neuralgic rheumatism.

Dr. Reed gives melilotus in cases where ergot would seem to be indicated; where there is fullness of circulation of the brain; a tendency to nose
bleed, often followed by sick headache; where the action of the heart is oppressed with occasional palpitation. He believes that in all three cases it is
an excellent remedy.

Therapy—Melilotus is a stimulant to the local circulation, and is adapted
to those cases where debility or a feeble vital power, as in delicate females
and poorly nourished infants, is associated with congestion, as in atonic neuralgias and spasms occurring during the period of dentition, and in congestion of the uterus, ovaries, rectum, bowels, stomach, or bladder in feeble
subjects. It is also a remedy for pain from determination of blood as in
headache with throbbing.

An ointment made from the leaves is an efficacious application to all
kinds of ulcers.

A fomentation of the leaves and flowering tops may be applied with
good effect in inflammation of joints, and local pain in the abdomen.

Engorged conditions of the uterus are treated very successfully by four
or five-drop doses every two hours of melilotus.

Synonyms—Pitcher Plant, Sidesaddle Plant, Fly Trap, Water Cup.

ConstITUENTS—Sarracenin, a resin, sarracenic acid.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Sarracenia. Dose, from two to twenty drops. Tincture Sarracenia. Dose, one dram.

Physiological Action—The agent is laxative, stimulating the action of
the intestinal glands and the liver and overcoming torpidity. It stimulates
the kidneys, inducing an abundant flow of limpid urine. It is an active
eliminating agent, exercising a special influence upon the glands of the skin.

Therapy—As a remedy in the treatment of zymotic disease this agent
has been used with good results. It is given freely during the course of

scarlet fever, measles and small-pox, and it is claimed that in every case
it modifies the character of these diseases, shortens their course, and prevents sequele. It has, as yet, no established place in therapeutics.

CALCIUM SULPHIDE.

Synonyms—Calx Sulphurata, Sulphurated Lime, Sulphuret of Calcium.

Administration—It should be thoroughly triturated with sugar of milk,
one grain of the salt with a dram of sugar of milk, being a good combination
for this trituration. From one to ten grains may be given at a dose, four
times daily, but good results will occur from the use of from one-twentieth
to one-fourth of a grain of the sulphide, every three hours.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent is specific to glandular, nodular,
and pustular suppurative inflammations, especially those of the skin. Carbuncles, acne and crops of boils and small pustules are cured by its internal
use. It has been most widely used in overcoming the tendency to the formation of crops of boils, and is generally relied upon for this purpose. Onetwentieth of a grain, four or five times daily, is effectual.

Therapy—It is also given in scrofulous conditions for the glandular indurations, or local ulcerations of this dyscrasia, to most excellent advantage.

In syphilitic diseases, with persistent bubos or nodular or ulcerative skin
eruptions, it is directly indicated. It has been used by excellent authorities
in the treatment of tubercular conditions wherever existing.

Shields claimed remarkable results in inflammatory diseases of the air
passages. In fetid bronchitis, and in fifty cases of pneumonia in which he
used the drug (in conjunction with quinine and nitroglycerine), the mortality was extremely small. In tonsillitis and quinsy its action was almost specific. In only four cases out of one hundred and fifty did it fail to effect a
complete cure in from two to six days.

A French writer gave a grain of the sulphide every hour to patients
with pulmonary consumption until gastric irritation occurred. This is an
extreme measure, but the author claimed satisfactory improvement. It will
certainly relieve the cough of this disease.

It is praised in tubercular diseases of the joints, as well as those of the
skin. If the tubercular conditions are complicated by syphilis, its benefits
are especially marked. It is administered in small doses in bronchial and
laryngeal troubles, in croup to produce immediate relief, and in persistent
and suffocative coughs.

This powder is a successful depilatory, and will remove hair in a few
moments. Applied moist, to the locality to be deprived of hair, it is allowed
to remain fifteen minutes, and is then removed with warm water and a
sponge.

It may be applied as sulphur, or dilute sulphuric acid, is applied to kill
the itch insect and destroy its eggs. This is effectually accomplished in a
short time, and the powder should then be washed off.

A writer, some years ago, advised this agent in small-pox claiming that
its internal use greatly modified the severity of the disease, and prevented
severe pitting. Its physiological influence would suggest its use as rational
treatment in this condition.

SOLANUM.; JATROPHA.

For several years the physicians of the south, stimulated by the writings of the late Dr. Burgess of Chattanooga, have used Jatropha, commonly
called in that locality, ‘‘Bull Nettle,’’ in the treatment of syphilis, with rather
remarkable results. The identity of the plant is not thoroughly established,
but recent investigators claim that it is the Solanum Carolinense, or Horse
Nettle of the north. Investigations made by the state of Tennessee identify
it as Solanum Rostratum.

Prof. Lloyd (writing the author) says, ‘‘under the common names
‘Horse Nettle’ and ‘Bull Nettle,’ both Solanum Rostratum and Solanum Carolinense, are gathered. They are botanically so nearly related as to make it
difficult for a collector to distinguish between them. Probably varieties of
each wedge into each other so that where they so commingle, that the collector would be unable to distinguish between them. Possibly the variety of
Solanum classified by Dr. Burgess as Bull Nettle is really the Solanum known
in the north as Horse Nettle, with radical differences from location that have
caused him to classify it as a different species.

Dr. Burgess prepared an infusion, or decoction rather, as he believed
that alcohol in the tincture would destroy its active properties. The root,
leaves, stem, and fruit supply medicinal properties, but the tea is best made
from the green root or from the whole green plant. A precise formula for
the decoction is not given. It readily decomposes unless combined with
glycerine in sufficient quantity to preserve it. The strong infusion is given in
doses of from one-half to two ounces, every three or four hours.

It is claimed that this remedy will stop the stench of severe cases of
syphilis in a few days, and will produce a sense of well being and a general
improvement in a very reasonable time. Dr. A. C. Cook of Georgetown, Kentucky, believes this to be the Solanum Rostratum. He confirms the statements of Dr. Burgess. He gives the strong infusion in wineglassful doses
every four hours. If there be constipation, he gives it more freely until the
bowels move two or three times a day, and then as before, for seven days.
For the next three days the medicine is discontinued entirely, to be again
resumed for another seven days. Dr. Cook agrees with Dr. Burgess that intoxicating liquors, tobacco, and all animal fats must be avoided, and in the
early part of the treatment, acids are incompatible. In the early stages, all
observers claim excellent results. In the latter stages of the disease, it requires considerable time, but the benefits are secured in a satisfactory way, and
leave the patient in excellent health.

The remedy is useful also in scrofula, necrosis of the bones, ulcers, tumors,
and various skin affections. One writer believes that it will prolong life,
health, and activity in the very old, promoting a sense of well being and warding off senility.

I introduce this remedy here, because of the very many expressions of
approval I have received throughout the south. The future will determine
its place and value. The Field Laboratory, Chattanooga, Tennessee, conducted
by Dr. Burgess’ daughters, supplies an infusion for trial, which is prepared
according to the Doctor’s method, or with glycerine, as may be desired.

ConstITUENTS—Volatile oil, tannin, gallic acid, arbutin, urson, ericolin,
sugar, gum.

Oil of Gaultheria (Oleum Gaultherie)—This oil is prepared by distilling
wintergreen leaves while fresh with water or steam. It is transparent and
colorless when recent, but soon becomes reddish from exposure. It has an
aromatic odor and a strong, spicy, agreeable taste. Pure oil of wintergreen
contains about 90 per cent of methylsalicylic acid. The dose of the oil is
five or ten drops, repeated every two or three hours, till some effect is produced, favorable or otherwise. If ringing in the ears is caused by the medicine, it should be discontinued or repeated in smaller doses when this effect
has passed off. The remedy in full doses is apt to cause dangerous depression in debilitated constitutions.

Salicylic acid, made from oil of wintergreen, is the only preparation of
the acid suitable for internal use.

A pure salicylate of soda is made from the salicylic acid of oil of wintergreen, which is preferred in the treatment of acute articular rheumatism;
while in neuralgia of the fifth cerebral nerve, tic douloureux, and gonorrheal rheumatism, the oil of wintergreen, in as large doses as can be borne,
is the better treatment. In other cases, a tincture of the fresh plant should
be employed.

It may be employed as a spray to the throat in diphtheria; and suitably
diluted, as a dressing for wounds; while it may be used internally for the
general purposes of an antiseptic.

PREPARATIONS—Specifie Gaultheria. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent is given successfully in the treatment of hemorrhoids from congestion of the pelvic circulation, hemorrhoids
with very painful external tumors, of a dark-purple color, with constipation,
with pain across the sacrum, and congestion of the portal circulation.

Therapy—It is of benefit in neuralgia, tic douloureux, gonorrheal rheumatism, inflammation of the bladder, irritation of the prostate gland, dysuria, sexual excitement in male or female, spermatorrhoa without impotency,
acute articular rheumatism, migraine, sciatica, diabetes, diphtheria, chronic
mucous discharges and toothache (locally). A liniment of the oil is useful
in allaying the pain of rheumatism.

Asthmatic breathing of a non-paroxysmal character is relieved by this
remedy, as is asthmatic cough, and cough characterized by constriction or
tightness at the supra-sternal notch. In the cough of asthmatic bronchitis,
or in dry, harsh, persistent bronchial or phthisical cough, this agent acts
nicely.

it is a serviceable remedy in hepatic congestion, and in congestion of the
glandular structures of the entire gastro-intestinal tract. Its influence over
the portal circulation is most pronounced.

In ovarian conditions inducing too frequent menstruation, with congestion of the pelvic circulation, in addition to the conditons above named, as
in enlargement of the uterus, with a swollen, engorged condition of the cervix, it is directly useful.

The oil is now freely used externally in the treatment of articular rheumatism and also in chorea with excellent results. In the latter disorder it is
applied, if necessary, over the upper and lower limbs, alternately, and over
the spine. It may be given internally at the same time. The application
may be confined with oiled silk.

__ An ointment made of ichthyol and the oil of gaultheria in a proper vehicle, rubbed together thoroughly, makes an excellent application to the
joints in acute, and in gonorrheal rheumatism. It acts equally well on the
original disease. Six drops of the oil is given three times a day, and this
will cure many cases. If given in conjunction with gelsemium and macrotys
in the first stages, it will probably shorten or even abort the disease.

ACIDUM SALICYLICUM.

Synonym—Salicylic Acid. Dose, from three to fifteen grains.

Physiclogical Action—Taken into the system, salicylic acid produces a
roaring in the head similar to that produced by quinine, an uncomfortable
fullness of the head, a sensation of distention with deafness and impaired
vision. There is trembling or muscular uncertainty, and reduction of reflex

From over-doses, Bartholow says strabismus or ptosis may occur, and
complete amaurosis has been temporarily induced. It has induced delirium,
restlessness, difficult breathing, feeble pulse, loss of control of the natural
evacuations. It induces general depression of the functions of the central
nervous system. It depresses the action of the heart, and the temperature
in large doses, to the extent in health of more than one and one-half degrees.
In elevated temperatures its influence is more conspicuous, but if the synthetic agent is used its influence is irregular and not to be relied upon. It
is destructive of the red blood corpuscles, destroying their oxygen carrying
power. It produces flushing of the face in its first influence, a suffusion of
the eyes and sweating which continues even if the temperature falls. Its
protracted use produces pallor and prostration with lowering of the vital
forces.

The agent is eliminated by all the natural emunctories, the natural form
much more freely than the synthetic acid. It has appeared in the urine in
fifteen minutes after its ingestion. It is usually, however, slow of absorption
and its elimination is correspondingly protracted.

The influence of the agent upon the kidneys must be watched, as it
sometimes acts as an irritant, producing congestion and hematuria, with
partial suppression, or slight albuminuria.

In examining the urine of patients taking salicylic acid or its salts, it
must be borne in mind that a reaction occurs from their presence with tests
for sugar, similar to that of sugar itself, and is often misleading.

Chemical changes occur in the intestinal canal by the action of the digestive and intestinal juices upon it, and the effete products of large doses produce an alteration in the character of the urine.

Salicylic acid is used in medicine largely in combination wth the alkaline bases, through its action on the neutral salts of these substances, because of their superior solubility. It was advised when the acid first came

into general use to dissolve it by the addition of the phosphate, acetate, carbonate, or other salt of sodium. This, of course, resulted in the formation
of the salicylate of sodium with phosphoric, acetic or carbonic acids as the
products. The sodium salt is now more universally used than any other
compound of the acid.

The bromides or hydrobromic acid in small doses will correct the unpleasant roaring in the head induced by this acid or by the salicylates, and
will permit their protracted use in cases where, when indicated, the patient
is susceptible to this influence.

Therapy—The therapeutic influence of salicylic acid in internal use is
largely comprehended in the therapeutics of the salicylate of sodium and
the other salicylates.

Salicylic acid is specifically a remedy for rheumatism. It is used to
best advantage in the acute and sub-acute forms, but will serve an excellent
purpose in the chronic forms of whatever character. It is now given in the
form of its soluble salts. Relapses are, however, more liable to occur after
this agent than after almost any other remedy.

It is advised by Ringer as of especial value in sciatica and lumbago, and
in some cases of migraine. It will serve a good purpose in many of these

The antiseptic, deodorant, stimulating and healing properties of the
agent are promptly and satisfactorily exhibited. It may be dissolved in hot
water and used as a mouth-wash in all conditions of ulceration of the mucous
membranes of the mouth or throat. It was commonly used in diphtheria at
one time, and was superior to other then known remedies.

In tonsillitis it seems to exercise a specific influence, operating efficiently
in small doses of one or two grains every two hours. It can be applied
directly to the tonsils if there is an exudate.

In the form of 8 spray it is useful in ozoena and fetid catarrh. It can be
finely pulverized, combined with a non-irritating powder and used as an
insufflation, or with a powder blower.

Internally the unaltered acid has been given in the treatment of ulcerations and cancerous conditions of the stomach and of the lungs, in all conditions wherein there was persistent foul breath or offensive expectoration.
From two to five grains are given as a dose in these cases. It corrects the
bad breath and quiets much of the discomfort present in ulcerative disease
of these organs.

It is of value in old indolent ulcers, in chronic tibial ulcers, in unhealthy granulating sores, and in cold abscesses. It is either dusted directly
on these sores or incorporated into an ointment, with a healing base.

It is used in pruritus, especially if accompanied with a moist discharge
from the part, similar to eczema. It is useful in a large number of skin diseases and has been especially advised in some tubercular and epitheliomatous
conditions of the skin.

It is in universal use as a constituent of corn salves and other bunion
fern corn cure remedies, and is useful in the treatment of chilblains and frost

ites.

Salicylic acid is an efficient agent in preventing fermentation. It is used
to prevent this process in canned fruits, in cider and grape juice, and in
other liquids subject to rapid decomposition. It is useful in preventing decomposition in urine preserved for future observation or analysis.

SODIUM SALICYLATE.

Formula—NaC,H,0,.

Synonym—Salicylate of sodium.

Physiological Action—The agent acts upon the economy similarly to
salicylic acid. Its ready solubility renders it much more valuable. It is irritating to the stomach to a limited extent. Although the salicylate of sodium
may be given with impunity in the conditions in which it is indicated, there
are certain undesirable, and in certain cases serious results, that follow its
use, which must be anticipated. The best known of these is the suppression
of the gastric fluids and interference with the digestion.

A writer in the Journal of Cutaneous Diseases mentions severe cases of
erythema and urticaria from its use. In another case twenty grains were
ordered to a man three times daily. After taking only three doses (one
dram) of the drug an urticarial eruption, quickly becoming petechial, appeared on the body and extremities. The hemorrhagic extravasation was so
great at certain points, as to cause subsequent sloughs and ulcers. Almost
every part of the surface of the body except the palms of the hands and
soles of the feet, were attacked during the course of the disease, accompanied by myalgic and arthritic pains. The tongue, larynx and pharynx were
affected by the eruption and were so swollen as to threaten suffocation. No
aoa pus was found in the urine and there was no disturbance of the

owels.

Therapy—In the larger part of the conditions named as benefited by
the use of salicylic acid this agent may be prescribed, often with better results than occur from the use of the acid.

It is perhaps the best of our remedies for rheumatism wherever located
and whatever the cause or duration. Both this agent and the acid may be
given internally and applied freely externally. They may be applied in
solution, or the powders may be sprinkled upon cotton and applied dry and
kept warm. There is authority for the statement that occasional large, full
doses of this sodium salt in rheumatism will act more rapidly, and produce
less gastric irritation, than if given in frequently repeated small doses.

Sodium salicylate has a specific influence in the treatment of acute

when there is fullness of the head across the eyes, with watery secretion, sneezing, chilliness, malaise and general depresseion. Two or three fifteen-grain doses of this salt, taken two hours apart, have often dissipated
every symptom for the writer. Supra-orbital pain from the above cause, or
of a neuralgic or rheumatic character, is most quickly dissipated by it.

This agent has a specific influence upon the schneiderian membrane. It
relieves irritation, reduces chronic thickness, regulates the secretion from
the mucous follicles and restores tone to relaxed membranes. In acute cases
it relieves pain. Knapp, of New York, has used the remedy in small doses
for many years, in the treatment of progressive deafness, resulting from
chronic catarrh. He gives five grains three or four times a day. The same
dose will be found beneficial in the treatment of uncomplicated chronic caLepdey A slow, progressive improvement will be noticed, if the agent be persisted in.

Having confidence in the action of the remedy, in the treatment of acute
colds in adults—coryza—I was induced to prescribe it in the snuffles of very
young infants. I dissolved five grains in one-third of a glass of water, perhaps an ounce and a half, and gave half teaspoonful doses every half hour. The
results were surprising, and from my experience I can urge the use of this
simple method in the cure of this condition.

The agent has been used to relieve eye strain, accompanied with ptosis.
The cases where its influence was marked were accompanied with a rheumatic
ae Fifteen grains of the remedy three times a day was the curative
ose.

Sodium Salicylate is of benefit in whooping-cough. Two or three grains
may be given twice or three times each day and excellent results obtained.

This remedy relieved a most severe case of universal cutaneous puritus of
nervous origin. Fifteen grains, three times daily, controlled the entire phenomena in three days.

In the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the mucous structures of the
kidneys and bladder, this agent is of much service, its influence being largely
due to its antiseptic and soothing properties. Upon the secretory function of
the kidneys in lithemia and rheumatism the salicylate of lithium, however, is
the preferable salt.

SALOL.

Synonyms—Pheny] salicylate, Salicylate of phenol.

Administration—It is prescribed in capsules of from three to six grains
every two or three hours. It is safest to discontinue for a few doses, after a
number of doses has been given, and to begin again subsequently, if indicated.

Physiological Action—In its physiological action it closely resembles its
constituents, salicylic and carbolic acids, as it is clearly proven that the compound is broken up by the action of the pancreatic juice, and these two
agents are released in the intestinal canal. This is determined by the presence of the carbolic acid products in the urine, and the evidences of salicylic
acid poisoning in the system. A dram of salol will release twenty-four
grains of carbolic acid in the system, as forty per cent of the substance is
of that acid, and the toxic effects of the agents are the phenomena of salieylic or carbolic acid poisoning.

It is stated by Huselbach, that if the kidneys are diseased, the elimination of the constituents of salol is retarded, and serious poisoning is much
more apt to occur. It intereferes with the excretory functions of the kidneys,
especially if their power is at all impaired. Its use must be avoided entirely
if these organs are diseased, and must be administered with careful discrimination in all diseases of the urinary apparatus. In small doses, it is beneficial, if the mucous lining only of the pelvis of the kidney is involved, as in
pyelitis, but it must not be given in pyelonephritis.

Therapy—Because of the antiseptic character of both the acids, salol is
prescribed freely as an intestinal antiseptic in all cases, whether of a febrile
or non-febrile character, where that influence is desired. It is given in catarrhal and fermentive diarrheas, in cholera morbus, and also in cholera. It
is prescribed in rheumatism, where the salicylic acid is indicated, and the
effects are identical with the influences of that agent. The liberation of the
acid in the intestinal canal in a form easily absorbed, may facilitate its action.

In catarrhal cystitis, with alkaline urine, it is directly serviceable, neutralizing the alkalinity and destroying disease germs.

Its use in specific urethritis is quite common, its curative influence depending largely upon its antiseptic properties in all these conditions.

It is prescribed by many physicians as an anodyne and pain-relieving
agent. it has but little influence other than in allaying irritation by destroying disease ferments, and other causes of painful disorder.

ASPIRIN,

Synonym—Acetylsalicylic Acid.

Aspirin is an intestinal antiseptic which by virtue of the salicylic acid
which it contains is used more for its influence upon the blood and metabolic
conditions.

The dose is from five to fifteen grains; the larger dose to be given three
times a day, the smaller dose more frequently.

It is crystalline needle-shaped in character, white and somewhat unpleasant to taste.

Therapy—It is used as a remedy for headaches and also as a sedative
in excitable and mild febrile conditions, but it is found that its best influences are exercised through the action of its salicylic derivative upon the
urates and uric acid—lithemic conditions.

This is one of the safer of the synthetics, and is proving to be quite useful for the purposes above mentioned.

The Salicylate of Strontium is advised in the treatment of rheumatism as sometimes a superior agent. It may be combined with bryonia,
phytolacca, or rhus, according to the indications. Dr. Bliss claims to get
better results from this than from other agents. He dissolves about six drams
in a quart of distilled water, adding to this two grains of the hyposulphate of
iron, and gives one or two teaspoonfuls three or four times a day.

SALICIN.

Formula—C,,H,,0,.

Description—A crystalline body, occurring in white or colorless, shiny,
silky needles, or in crystalline powder having a bitter taste but odorless. It
is soluble in water which contains an equal part of alcohol, at sixty degrees
Fahrenheit. Dose, from two to ten grains.

Specific Symptomatology—Periodicity, when general debility is present,
accompanied with severe pain. Periodicity in fevers, with prostration. Intermittent or remittent fevers, accompanied by rheumatic manifestations. It
is a sedative to fevers, where intermittency or rheumatism are present. Some
physicians use it indiscriminately in fevers.

Therapy—Physicians who are in the habit of prescribing this remedy and
have had experience with it, claim for it a wider field than is exercised by
other remedies of this class. They claim that it will control fever, even when
malaria is not present. While some class it with quinine, they claim that it
has a much milder, and less irritating effect than quinine, which is exercised
with equal positiveness. It is especially advantageous where there is periodical neuralgia with feebleness, cold skin, and feebleness of the circulation.
In sciatica, lumbago and in the various forms of rheumatic neuralgia, or
myalgia, it is a valuable remedy. As a restorative tonic, during convalescence from prostrating disease, it has been favorably used, and is highly
spoken of. There is no doubt that the remedy better known will be found
to be an important one. It should have more extended investigation. While
not in common use, this agent is a reliable one, and important and deserves
further investigation.

POTASSIUM ACETATE.

Formula—KC,H,0,.

Synonym—Acetate “of Potassium.

Physiological Action—It is directly a renal depurant, increasing the
amount of solids in the urine, by stimulating both the excretion and secretion. It has but little influence upon the excretion of the watery portion of
the urine. In large doses it produces aching and even pains in the kidneys.
It promotes retrograde metabolism throughout the system and inercases
waste, thus acting as a direct alterative. This is plainly apparent when the
sudoriparous glands are inactive and the skin becomes rough and coarse, or
pimples, pustules and other skin disease is present. It stimulates excretion
by the kidneys and relieves the irritation of the skin, and thus facilitates the
cure of these conditions.

Therapy—This agent may be used instead of the iodide of potassium, as
an alterative in eczema and other skin diseases of childhood, and will be
found a valuable remedy.

In glandular eee of childhood, where an iodide is usually prescribed, this simple remedy, combined with vegetable alteratives, will often
produce all of the good effects, with none of the unpleasant results, of the
iodide. In glandular inflammations, acute and chronic, it is a valuable agent.
If given in full doses of from ten to fifteen grains with aconite, every two
hours, in the first stages of mastitis, ovarititis or orchitis, it will often abate
the disease within eighteen hours. It is most reliable.

If the kidneys are normal it will hasten the removal of morbific products in all acute inflammations, but its administration must be conducted
with discretion, and the kidneys must not be over-taxed. It is best given
with an abundance of water, that the solid waste stimulated in the kidneys,
may be fully diluted.

It neutralizes excessive acidity probably to a limited extent by decomposition and liberation of the alkaline potassium carbonate.

It has been much used in rheumatism, but is now largely replaced by the
salicylates, which accomplish the same and often increased results. It is,
however, the best remedy of the two where the stomach refuses to tolerate
the salicylic acid salts as it often does.

Cloths wet in a hot solution of acetate potassium are most valuable as
an application to acute rheumatism inflammation of the joints.

In litheemia its influence is most direct. The dosage prescribed in these
cases is usually too large. It works more satisfactorily if given in doses of
one or two grains, five or six times daily, quickly relieving the aching in the
back, so common to this condition, and promoting a clear and normal urine,
reducing, instead of increasing, the specific gravity.

It acts upon the liver promptly, stimulating a flow of bile, and overcoming hepatic congestion. It has long been used in jaundice, and exercises
a desirable influence upon the glands of the entire intestinal tract.

It is a remedy for boils and other persistent skin eruptions, and will be
found valuable in carbuncle as an active eliminative.

POTASSIUM CHLORATE.
Formula—KCl0,.
Synonym—Chlorate of potassium.
Physiological Action—The physiological action of this agent is that of
an irritant poison. It depresses the action of the heart, lowers arterial ten-

sion, disorganizes the red blood corpuscles, converting the hemoglobin into
methemoglobin. The product of the disorganization is excreted by the urine.
It produces enlargement of the liver, kidneys and spleen, inducing inflammation of the entire gastro-intestinal tract. When death occurs from its
use there is delirium and coma or convulsions. Continued use of the agent
even in medicinal doses may produce irritation and congestion of the kidneys with albuminous urine and difficult renal action. It is apt to produce
cutaneous eruptions, papular, vesicular, or erythematous in character.

Therapy—The agent is an active antiseptic, although not usually so
classed. In the early treatment of diphtheria it first came into prominent
use as a remedy for ‘that disease, for which it was used in conjunction with
the chloride of iron. Given after exposure, before the development of the
symptoms, it is said to ward off an attack of the disease. Its solution is
useful in all cases of ulceration of the mouth or of the stomach. It is given
in frequent doses, and is used freely as a mouth wash, especially valuable if
the gums are spongy and tend to bleed readily, and there is fetid breath. It
is specific in mercurial stomatitis and was long advised in conjunction with
mercurial treatment, to prevent the salivating influence of mercury. It prevents the formation of false membrane and hastens its detachment in membranous croup. It is useful in the sore throat of scarlatina, but it must be
given with caution in this disease, because of its irritating influence upon
the kidneys. 0

Its solution is useful in specific or non-specific urethritis, vaginitis and
cystitis, in which mild solutions are more efficacious than saturated ones. It
is useful also in hemorrhoids and in rectal ulcers and fissures.

It has been used in phthisis pulmonalis, in syphilis, scrofula and in
scurvy, but its use in these conditions is now obsolete as we have many
superior remedies. Local ulcerations of the mouth or throat, or
ulcerations of any mucous surface occurring in the course of these constitutional diseases may be well treated with this salt in solution, but its continued internal use is not advised.

This agent is useful in the treatment of leucorrhea, and in ulcerations
of the os uteri or of the walls of the vagina, in solution in a douche.

SALOPHEN.

Synonym—<Acetylparamidophenyl Salicylate.

Therapy—It is a safer remedy than salol, and quite as sure in the same
conditions where the effect of salicylic acid in the blood is desired, and it
will probably act with much less irritation upon the kidneys. Its influence
upon the bladder and mucous membranes of the genito-urinary tract is probably much less active than that of salol. Dose 5 to 20 grains.

CHROMIUM. CHROMIUM SULPHATE.

Chromium was discovered by Vaquelin in 1797, and its salts had been
used in the arts, but it is only within a little more than a decade that it has
been suggested in medicine. The leading materia medicas do not mention
chromium sulphate. Kolipinski, in 1902, presented this remedy to the Ameriean Therapeutic Society. He stated that he had been using it with results
that would justify its general adoption. He gave it in doses of four grains,
three times a day. Since that time familiarity with it, and an absence of

toxic symptoms have caused the dosage to be increased to more than double
this amount in certain cases, and occasionally thirty or forty grains have
been given with only mild vertigo and some uncertainty of muscular action.
It has been continued over long periods without unpleasant results.

It is used first for its influence upon the prostate gland; also in neurasthenia, exopthalmic goiter, and locomotor ataxia. It has cured these conditions, especially the second, without the usual auxiliaries of rest and
travel. Its effect upon exophthalmic goiter has been a pleasing one, in some
cases, and in many it has exercised a beneficial effect. It has been used in
uterine fibroid, in interstitial fibroid, in all forms of prostatic trouble, and
in senile pruritus.

It has been given for impotency and faults with the menopause and
growths in the female breast. It has been prescribed for nervous vomiting
or the vomiting of pregnancy, and for various forms of headache. The conditions for which it is now preferred are enlargement of the prostate, enlargement of the thyroid gland or exophthalmic goiter, and the several nervous conditions named above. In the tachycardia of exophthalmic goiter,
the irregular action of the heart is controlled usually and a normal action is
induced. The latter symptoms with trembling, slowly ceasing. The remely
acts more promptly in early cases than in later cases, and this same holds
true in locomotor ataxia.

In my own cases of enlarged prostate, while I thought I got good results from its action, I found that I got better results by combining it with
thuja, and later with thuja and saw palmetto. I would certainly advise its
further observation.

Two cases of lateral sclerosis of the spinal cord were cured with this
remedy. Another physician used it in heart burn of long standing, five
grains three times a day and cured his patients.

Physiological Action—Iron is an essential and constant constituent, a
proximate of the animal organism. It is taken into the system with the food
of which it is a constituent, being absorbed by plants which serve that purpose, from the soil. It floats in the blood as the most important component
of the red corpuscle a little less than one-half of one per cent of the total
constituents of the red corpuscle, consisting of iron.

It is also present in the gastric juice, bile, chyle, lymph, milk and urine,
and in various pigments, notably those of the eye.

During the administration of iron the red blood corpuscles increase in
number as well as in their oxygen-carrying power, the quantity of hematin
and hemoglobin, and also the total quantity of the blood being increased,
at the same time.

410 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

By the improvement of the blood and the increased supply of oxygen
to the tissues occasioned by the administration of iron when this agent is
deficient, the nervous system is directly influenced in a most favorable manner. There is increased strength and a greatly augmented power to resist
disease, and to sustain the vital functional operations of the various organs
of the body.

An objection to the administration of iron as a medicine is the inorganic
character of the agent, which materially interferes with its appropriation.
The more nearly we are enabled to approach to an organic compound of iron,
the more speedily and satisfactorily will the influence of the agent be exercised. A commendable effort is being made by various manufacturers to separate the iron from pure blood for internal administration.

The matter of speedy absorption must be considered in selecting an iron
salt, as elementary iron is not used in medicine, the compounds alone being
prescribed. Whatever compound is selected for this purpose the proportion
absorbed is very small and the amount given in excess of the appropriation
is usually eliminated with the feces, imparting to them a black color.

The oxides, the sulphates, the carbonate, the phosphates, and the chloride of iron are among its most easily appropriated salts. For the application
of iron in general, we refer our readers to the consideration of the remarks
under the headings of these various salts.

FERRI CHLORIDUM.

Synonym—Chloride of Iron, Muriate of Iron, Ferric Chloride.

Preparations—The Tincture of the Chloride of Iron is prepared by dissolving the chloride in alcohol. It is a clear, dark reddish-brown liquid with
a sharp, astringent taste, and an acid reaction. It may be mixed with water
in all proportions without precipitation. Dose, from three to fifteen minims, fully diluted.

The Ethereal Tincture of the Chloride of Iron, prepared by dissolving
one ounce of the crystals of ferric chloride in twelve ounces of ether which
has been mixed with four times its bulk of alcohol. Dose, from two to ten
minims, fully diluted.

Therapy—tThe tincture of the chloride of iron has a wide range in therapeutics, in addition to its direct influence in restoring the red blood corpuscles. It exercises a direct tonic influence upon the stomach and is also
a powerful astringent antiseptic and restorative to a high degree, especially
in general atonicity without fullness of the blood vessels—with anemia. It
is not a direct nerve tonic, its influence upon the nervous system being exercised through its restorative influence upon the red blood corpuscles, and
the consequent renewal of vitality thus induced, enhanced by the increased
power of the blood to carry oxygen.

The agent is demanded in anemia which has occurred from the sudden
loss of blood from acute hemorrhage. In cases of this character the blood
is not impaired and the agent quickly restores to this fluid its full quantity
of red corpuscles. It is no less efficient in anemia from chronic disease or
in that form which occurs slowly from a gradual destruction of red corpuscles in the system. In chlorosis it acts well, but other forms of iron are
usually more efficacious, as it is necessary in the larger proportion of cases
to treat other existing conditions, usually disorders of menstruation.

IRON AND ITS COMPOUNDS 411

In depraved conditions of the blood, resulting from the absorption of
septic matter it is a most important remedy. It imparts tone to the system,
antagonizing the influence of the poison, while it destroys the poison itself,
at the same time restoring the blood if impoverished.

In local poisoning where septic material has been introduced into
wounds, and the course of the infection is marked by the appearance of active inflammation along the course of the lymphatics, the reddened areas
may be painted with the tincture, while it is also administered internally.
It may also be applied directly to the wound, but there are milder antiseptics that we may use for this purpose that are less irritating and fully as
efficacious. Iodine is a better application.

In the treatment of acute erysipelas the tincture of iron has long been
considered a specific. It is applied directly to the inflamed surfaces, and at
the same time to a narrow area of healthy tissue beyond the line of inflammation. This retards further advancement of the disease, and is especially
indicated if the tissues are of a dark, deep red color. Ten drops of the tinceture, freely diluted, should be given internally at the same time, every two
or three hours.

This tincture was one of the first successful remedies used in the treatment of diphtheria. If the mucous membranes are swollen and engorged,
and of a deep red color, its influence is exercised most speedily. It was commonly administered in combination with the chlorate of potassium, fifteen
grains of the latter being dissolved in two ounces of water to which a dram
of the tincture is added. A teaspoonful of this every two hours was given to
a ten year old child. The tincture may be diluted and used as a gargle, and
in extreme conditions the swollen areas, which are covered with the characteristic exudate, may be gently painted with it in full strength.

This simple course of treatment was very successful in the past, especially when the specific indications of the constitutional involvement have
been met with aconite, phytolacca, belladonna, or other indicated measures.

Whenever prescribed, if the indications for an acid in the system are
present, such as dark mucous membranes, the narrow, red tongue with thin
tip and edges, the influence of the agent is more promptly exercised.

In the treatment of chronic inflammation of the kidneys where there is
a large waste of albumin, the tincture of iron is a most efficacious remedy.
In these cases there is deficiency of action of all the vital organs, and anemia.
The blood pressure in the kidneys is greatly altered and the general vital
force is much reduced. As stated, the possible precipitation of a large quantity of albumin is the indication for its use, although it is beneficial in certain cases where the quantity is not large. In an experience of many years
in the treatment of albuminuria, the writer has learned to prefer the ethereal
tincture of the ordinary tincture of the chloride in these cases. Five to eight
drops of the ethereal, will acomplish the same results as twice that quantity
of the ordinary tincture.

The tincture of iron is of much service in the treatment of pyelitis, reducing the quantity of pus formed more rapidly than other agents. The
diuretic effects of the tincture are of much service in these cases, especially
if dropsy is present as a complication. It stimulates the digestive and appropriative organs, it forms new blood and thereby increases the quantity of
oxygen in the system. It increases nerve force and through the nervous system the strength of the heart’s action. It thus materially increases the blood
pressure in the kidneys, and in every way improves functional activity. It
reduces the quantity of uric acid and the phosphates in the urine, when excessive, and relieves the consequent irritation. In antiseptic properties
further inhibit the formation of pus.

In pulmonary tuberculosis the tincture of iron controls the night sweats,
hemorrhage, bronchorrhea, and diarrhea, its tonic influence in these cases
being most marked.

The styptic properties of this agent render it advantageous in all conditions of passive hemorrhage. Vegetable astringents, however, have
largely replaced the use of the tincture of iron for this purpose.

Binz claims that ether given in conjunction with iron greatly facilitates
the absorption of the latter. He especially advises the use of ethereal tincture of the chloride of iron in chlorosis. The author, in a long experience
in the treatment of chronic kidney disease, has long ago replaced the tincture of the chloride of iron and the other non-ethereal preparations by this
preparation of the German pharmacopeia. Its action in the consequent
anemia of albuminuria is much more prompt, reliable and satisfactory. The
smallness of the dose, from three to eight drops, also commends it.

The tincture of the chloride of iron, like many of its other salts, has an
injurious influence upon the teeth, acting chemically upon the enamel,
softening and destroying it. It precipitates the iron and produces a permanent black discoloration, for which reason it should usually be taken in high
dilutions or through a glass tube or a straw.

The tincture in combination with dilute phosphoric acid makes an excellent tonic which may be freely administered after protracted disease, especially in convalescence from malarial disease.

This mixture is nearly or quite colorless and very palatable, especially
if added to a little water in a glass. In it a chemical change takes place
which rather enhances the value of the constituents. In proper doses its influence as a tonic for children is exceedingly prompt and satisfactory. It
is given to them also when convalescing from severe stomach or bowel
trouble, when the nervous system is debilitated, and the blood is deficient
in red corpuscles.

If one grain of strychnine be added to each pint of the above compound
its influence will be broadened.

Incompatibles—The chloride of iron is incompatible with the salts of
the metallic elements, with the compounds of silver and mercury, with all
the arsenates and arsenites, the borates, and those vegetable compounds
which contain tannin, albumin or gums.

FERRI SULPHAS.

Synonyms—Green Vitriol, Ferrous Sulphate, Sulphate of Iron.

Ferri Sulphas Exsiccatus is the sulphate of iron deprived by heat of its
water of crystallization. It is a grayish-white powder perfectly but slowly
soluble in water. It contains sixty-five per cent of the original sulphate.

Ferri Sulphas Granulatus.

Synonym—Granulated Ferrous Sulphate.

For many years the sulphate of iron has been a popular tonic and
restorative, and is the active constituent of many well known formule. In
its tonic properties it rapidly supplies iron to the system, and is given with-

out special regard to nice discrimination, in all atonic conditions, where
there is anemia. As a restorative to the menstrual function which has
ceased in anemic and chlorotic cases, it is one of the best of the iron compounds. It permits a natural restoration of the function by supplying the
necessary iron to the red blood corpuscles, but it is an emmenagogue only
in such atonic conditions, and will not force a restoration of the function
when suppressed from other causes. This agent has powerful astringent
properties, and has long been used in both active and passive hemorrhages.
In chronic pulmonary disease its tonic properties are of much value, while
its astringent action restrains the tendency to hemorrhage and profuse night
sweats. Its astringent and tonic effects are also evident when there is
chronic or profuse diarrhea with tendency to intestinal hemorrhage. As it
has the properties of an irritant, it must be given in small doses. One grain
every three hours is much better than five grains three times a day, and
in many cases one grain three times a day will be quite sufficient. It is a useful remedy in diabetes, either of the saccharine
or non-saccharine variety. The agent, externally applied, either in the form
of a fine powder or in strong solution, will control many cases of traumatic
hemorrhage. In solution it is also applied externally to chronic ulcers and
moist eozema, and is used in a douche in profuse leucorrhea. It is applicable as a wash in open cancers, especially cancer of the uterus, in the proportion of one or two drams to a quart of hot water. A solution kept in
contact with recently extruded piles will sometimes cause their rapid disappearance.

LIQUOR FERRI SUBSULPHATIS.

Synonym—Monsel’s solution, solution of ferric subsulphate, solution of
subsulphate of iron.

Description—This preparation is not widely different from the liquor of
the persulphate of iron, either of which evaporated with moderate heat will
yield a light, reddish-brown, deliquescent crystalline substance known as
Monsel’s salt.

Therapy—It is not given to any extent internally, its influence being
specifically that of a powerful local styptic. In contact with the blood it
produces immediate coagulation, the coagulum extending into the open vessels, thus occluding them. In hemorrhage of the stomach and bowels it may
be given internally in doses of from two to five minims diluted, and in hemoptysis it may be used in an atomizer, also in bleeding from the post-nasal
eavity. For application to wounds the solution is preferable to the powder,
as the coagulum from the former is more easily removed than that which
forms in the presence of the crystalline salt.

FERRIFERROCYANIDUM.

Pormula—Fe,Fe,(CN),.

Synonyms—Prussian blue, ferric ferrocyanide, ferrocyanide of iron.

Administration—In its administration it may be given in doses of from
two to five grains, four times daily, in a capsule. Its value is sometimes enhanced by giving it in conjunction with quinine.

Therapy—In pernicious intermittent fevers when quinine has apparently lost, or exerts no influence, this agent sometimes produces a pro-

found antiperiodic effect. In severe pain of neuralgic, malarial or even of
uncertain character, appearing periodically, but with long intervals of one,
three, five or seven weeks, if this agent is given in small doses for a few
days preceding the expected paroxysm it will break up the periodicity when
every other known measure has failed. The writer treated a case of facial
neuralgia in a woman of a very nervous temperament. The attacks were
exceedingly violent, and the patient was susceptible to the action of morphine, and, in fact, ultimately died from the administration of a simple one_ fourth grain dose given by a physician who did not understand her idiosyncrasies. The attacks of neuralgia had occurred at regular intervals of five
weeks for eleven years without having been controlled but once, and that
only for a very short time. There was no reappearance of the pain after
this agent was used, for six or seven months. A mild attack after complete
exhaustion was then completely controlled, and there was no recurrence for
over a year, when in a distant town a physician unfortunately administered morphine for a mild attack, with the result mentioned.

This agent is specific in certain cases of vomiting, and should be given
in minute doses frequently repeated. In many of these cases the persistency
of the vomiting may have withstood better known agents.

The tonic properties of this salt of iron are not as great, because of its
insoluble character, as those of others of the salts, but in certain cases it has
an influence peculiarly its own, which is very satisfactory.

FERRUM REDUCTUM.

Synonyms—Quevenne’s iron, reduced iron, iron by hydrogen.

Description—This is in fact a powder of iron, light, tasteless, without
luster, and of an iron-gray color. Because of the presence of hydrogen it
takes fire readily. It is insoluble in both water and alcohol. It has long
been considered one of the very best of the iron tonics. It supplies iron directly to the system, is comparatively free from astringency and irritating
properties. It is given wherever a pure iron tonic is needed and is especially available for administration to children. In its administration three
grains in a pill or capsule or in the powder may be given every three or four

ours.

A test of the purity of this agent may be made by igniting a quantity of
it, when it should burn in sparks. If it does not ignite an impurity is present, probably in the form of an oxide. It should not yield sulphureted hydrogen gas.

Ferrum Dialyzatum.

Dialyzed iron is a common preparation of iron of rather unstable char
acter. It yields up its iron freely in the system and with many practitioners
is commonly used in anemia in preference to other preparations of iron. It
is said to serve as an efficient antidote to arsenic without further preparation.
It is prescribed in liquid form and is easily precipitated from its solution. The
dose of the solution is ten or fifteen minims in water.

FERRI CARBONAS.

Formula—FeCO,-+H,0.

Synonym—Carbonate of iron.

Admninistration—In the administration of this remedy, while five or six
grains during twenty-four hours are considered a small dose, this amount is
without doubt more than is absorbed. There can be no advantage in prescribing a greater amount, although it is not uncommon with some physicians to give ten grains four or five times a day. From one-half to one grain
will usually do as well as a larger dose.

Therapy—tThe restorative powers of this salt are very great, while the
facility of its absorption, the absence of irritating properties and its tastelessness render it of especial value in therapeutics. There are but few
atonic conditions in which iron is needed where this remedy is contra-indicated, its beneficial action being particularly marked in all debilitated conditions. Its influence upon the stomach is most gratifying, as it stimulates the
normal secretion, is not astringent, overcomes rapidly excessive catarrhal discharges by its tonic properties and materially improves the digestion.
Blaud’s pill, which has been popular for nearly a century, contains as its
principal constituent the carbonate of iron. The writer has learned to depend upon the following formula as a specific in certain atonic conditions of
the stomach, or catarrhal gastritis:

Ferri Carbonat. 1.0.20.. 0. cece cece cece cece eee e eee e eee eeeee 38s

Hydrastine. 11.0.. cece eee ee eens eee

Capsiciepeer eet EC CCEL EE ECC EEE LCL ECEE eee E reer ee rere errr

Mix and divide into capsules no. xxx.

Sig. Take one after each meal.

In extreme debility one of these capsules may be given every three hours,
but always after eating, however small the amount partaken of, even if no
more than a few mouthfuls of bread or any other plain food.

In conditions where quinine is indicated this may be added to the prescription very satisfactorily. In cases which demand nux vomica, especially
if there is prostration of the nervous system, this latter makes a most valuable addition to the formula. In other cases the crude powdered golden seal
may replace the hydrastine to good advantage, but at least double the quantity should be used. Whitford has used this formula for nearly half a century, but with the addition of xanthoxylum in the place of capsicum.

Very often the formation of boils, inflamed abscesses, and especially
pustular conditions of the skin of the face and aggravated cases of acne,
depend upon a condition of the blood, which is speedily corrected by the action
of this remedy. The formation of crops of boils, which has continued for
months, may be terminated and the boils cured within a short time, by administering a grain of this salt every two or three hours, This is a very
reliable treatment in these stubborn conditions.

This agent is of much value in the treatment of the anemia present with
chorea, and may be combined with other tonics or nerve sedatives. In amenorrheea, due to anemia, this agent is of service, as it rapidly improves the
condition of the blood, thus promoting the natural restoration of the function.

FERRI OITRAS.

Synonyms—Frric Citrate, Citrate of Iron.

Administration—This is an excellent form of iron for administration;
soluble, easily appropriated, pleasant and crystalline. It may be given in
solution, pill or capsule form. The medium dose is five grains, three or four

times daily.

FERRI ET STRYCHNINE CITRAS.
(Citrate of Iron and Quinine.)

FERRI ET QUININZ ET STRYCHNINZ CITRAS.
(Citrate of Iron, Quinine and Strychnine.)

Administration—The above are given in doses of from two to ten grains,
and are best dispensed in a syrup or aromatic vehicle as they are exceedingly bitter. A good extemporaneous method is to make up the prescription by completely dissolving the total quantity of the citrate or tartrate in
about seventy-five per cent of its total liquid bulk of equal parts of water
and simple elixir, and subsequently adding twenty-five per cent of syrup of
liquorice. If the crystals are entirely dissolved this will make a comparatively permanent and palatable compound.

Therapy—They are excellent tonics and act in a satisfactory manner in
debilitated conditions where their constituents are plainly applicable.

They have the restorative properties of iron, the tonic but not the antiperiodic properties of quinine, or the nerve stimulant properties of strychnine in its compounds.

In malarial regions where there are apt to be malarial complications,
with all fevers and acute inflammatory conditions, these salts are of great
efficacy. Appropriate selection may be made according as the debility involves the nervous system, or the functional operations of the vital organs,
or the assimilation of nutrition.

FERRI PHOSPHAS SOLUBILIS.

Synonym—Soluble Ferric Phosphate.

This salt is given in doses of from five to ten grains in syrup or in aromatic elixir.

Physiological Action—It possesses the tonic properties of both iron and
phosphorus. Both of these substances are actual food for the brain and nerv-

ous system and in debilitated conditions where there is lack of nutrition
of the nervous system, this salt is important, although not as valuable as
free phosphorus or a combination of the iron and alkaline phosphates.

Therapy—It is indicated in those conditions following exhausting diseases where the exhaustion is apparent in inactivity of the digestive and appropriative organs, and in diminished nerve force. In the cure of many
forms of indigestion, the phosphate of iron performs an important function.
It increases the tone of the stomach, and stimulates the secretion of the gastric and intestinal juices.

FERRI PYROPHOSPHAS SOLUBILIS.

Synonyms—Soluble pyrophosphate of iron, soluble ferric pyrophosphate.

Dose. From two to five grains.

Therapy—It is given in anemic conditions where debility is marked or
where there are evidences of neurasthenia. In convalescence from prostrating disease where there is general loss of nerve power, this agent in many
cases will be found superior to the phosphate. It is further applicable in all
eases where the phosphate is indicated.:

Compound Syrup of the Phosphates.

For perhaps sixty years there has been on the market a syrup known as
Parrish’s Chemical Food, the Compound Syrup of the Phosphate of Iron, or
the Compound Syrup of the Phosphates. This compound was widely used
with success in nervous prostration, but the complex character of its formula, which was afterwards made known by Dr. Parrish, makes it difficult
to prepare. It has recently been replaced by other manufacturers by a
palatable and efficient syrup of the phosphates. The following is the original
formula of Dr. Parrish, but it is much too complicated for general prescribing, in fact, the character of its constituents are such that it is inadvisable to undertake to construct it unless skilled in pharmacy. Simpler
combinations, or the direct prescribing of its single constituents, will often
prove of greater service.

In an extreme case of ‘‘starved nerves’’ in a pregnant woman where
there was spinal irritation in a most exaggerated form, with violent insanity,
the writer relieved the entire train of symptoms, restoring perfect mental
action and producing quiet and rest, which had not been produced for six
weeks previously, except by the continued use of morphine, in less than ten
days, by the use of Parrish’s syrup in frequent doses and forced concentrated nutrition.

Spinal irritation will yield more quickly to this combination than to any
of its single constituents. It is demanded in all cases of nervous prostration
with anemia. It is advisable not to continue the use of any single tonic or
restorative in nervous prostration for a greatly prolonged period; better results are obtained by selecting two or three of this class of preparations
which seem to be adapted to the case, and rotating them in order, changing
every twenty-one or twenty-eight days.

FERRI OXIDUM HYDRATUM.

Formula—Fe, (OH),.

Synonyms—F'erric hydrate, ferric hydroxide, hydrated oxide of iron,
red oxide of iron, hydrated peroxide of iron, hydrated sesquioxide of iron.

Therapy—tThis substance has no practical use in therapeutics beyond its
power to at once convert arsenous acid into an insoluble arsenic compound
of iron, which is comparatively innocuous.

When arsenic has been taken into the stomach this antidote can be at
once prepared and administered. It is given in teaspoonful doses of the
moist magma every few minutes until a quantity equal to at least twenty
times the bulk of the arsenic taken, has been administered. It is then advisable to at once introduce the stomach pump and thoroughly evacute the
stomach, or evacuation can be accomplished by the use of an emetic.

FERRI ARSENAS.

Synonym—Arsenate of Iron, iron arsenate.

Administration—It is administered in pill form in doses of from onesixteenth to one-eighth of a grain three times daily. The smaller dose should
be used in the beginning, and it will seldom be found necessary to administer a larger one than one-tenth of a grain.

Therapy—Its direct administration is in those diseases of the skin
where arsenic is of acknowledged value, when accompanied by anemia or a
blood dyscrasia. In cases of eczema, where there is prostration, it has been
of much service, and is more useful if the disease is of the dry than if of
the moist variety. It is of much value in scaly conditions, with extreme inaction of the glands of the skin. Some cases of impetigo, psoriasis, and
even lepra, yield to it. In chronic diarrhca, where there is impairment of
the red blood corpuscles it is of value.

IRON AS AN ANTIPYRETIC.

Those who have followed the methods of Schussler closely have become
enthusiastic over the action of the phosphate of iron in trituration, in the
control of uncomplicated fever. It is superior often to any other remedy (see
Tissue remedies), especially with children. A very thorough trituration equal
to the third decimal trituration of the Homeopathist is the preparation I use
the most. Of this fifteen or twenty grains added to four ounces of boiling
water is cooled to the proper temperature and given hot every ten or fifteen
minutes especially in sudden high temperatures. Usually other remedies
may be discontinued while this is being given.

The promptness with which the temperature drops depends upon the
persistency of the cause. But in from two to six hours, there is a marked
reduction in the temperature. This method is especially adapted to the
acute inflammatory diseases of childhood, especially pneumonia where it has
in ae cases, for me, covered all the pathological conditions for a short

Dr. Stephens claims that the citrate of iron in small doses, frequently
repeated, will produce the same result. He puts ten grains of the soluble
citrate into a four ounce mixture and gives a teaspoonful every ten or
fifteen minutes. Other writers have used the tincture of iron alone, in small
doses. When we have the characteristic specific symptoms for an acid (as
this preparation is acid in reaction), from one-fourth of a drop to one drop
at a dose, it is claimed, will exercise a direct controlling influence over the
temperature. The above suggestions should receive our attention. If these
facts can be confirmed by experience, they will prove of much value, as
they will enable us to replace agents that are depressing in character, when
depressants are contra-indicated by those which by their inherent properties
ha sustain and build up the system outside of their possible sedative

TINCTURE OF IODINE. SODIUM IODIDE. HYDRIODIC ACID.
OLEUM MORRHUZ.
IODINE.

Note. Because of the fact that iodine is obtained from organic sources,
direct, we may well class it as an organic remedy. It is readily absorbed,
and just as readily eliminated through all the emunctories. It as readily
applies itself in line with the demands of the system for this agent, in the
same manner and with much the same facility and felicity as the organic
principles of the plant drug. In these particulars, it is superior to iron and
eminently superior in the rational character of its influence to the common
inorganic remedies.

Symbol—I.

Administration—Iodine is given in the aqueous solutions hereinafter
named, or in the form of the tincture, or in its compounds. The crystalline
substance i is not a desirable form for administration, although sometimes so
prescribed.

logical Action—In its influence upon the nervous system, Iodine
produces depression of spirits, mental distress and disinclination to exertion. There is lassitude, muscular debility, and increasing feebleness, with
depression of the heart and circulatory apparatus.

In its influence upon the stomach in small doses it acts as a tonic and
sedative, i in large doses producing salivation, general discomfort and colicky
pains; in extreme cases vomiting and purging. In excessive doses Iodine
has produced death by exciting severe gastro-enteritis. With this condition
there are a rapid and feeble pulse, deathly pallor, and irritation of the kidneys, with ultimate suppression of urine.

Todism, from the protracted use of this agent in any form, manifests itself by a peculiar metallic taste in the mouth upon rising in the morning, increased salivation, with sore mouth and tenderness of the gums, irritation
of the post-nasal cavity, and perhaps watery eyes, the symptoms closely resembling those of hay-fever or rose cold. There is an eruption upon the
skin, acne rosacea appears and this is followed by boils, or perhaps purpura, There is sore throat, in many cases severe and painful, and an excessive frontal headache. Some patients are exceedingly susceptible to the
above symptoms and even nervous phenomena with impaired vision, paresis,
anemia, and atrophy of the glandular organs, especially of the mammary
glands and testes, with a marked loss of sexual power, may appear in many
cases. As an antidote, starch and starchy substances may be freely administered, and a solution of the bicarbonate of sodium and occasional hypodermie injections of the active stimulants, are sometimes indicated.

Iodine has been called the king of alteratives, but no satisfactory explanation has yet been given of its influence in this line. I believe it is due
to its innate organic character. It is argued that the virtues of all vegetable
alteratives are exercised through the iodine they contain. But we have
vegetable alteratives which are possessed of equal and in some cases greater
powers than iodine, in which iodine is not conspicuous as a constituent.
This agent in its influence resembles the organic remedies closely in its elimination; it acts more like the inorganic agents.

In harmony with the teachings of Germain-Sée, iodine probably stimulates a more perfect absorption of nutritive material, and encourages perfect elimination of all waste products. This elimination takes place with
much activity through the skin, kidneys, salivary and mucous glands, especially those of the intestinal canal. When the compounds of iodine are
taken by nursing women, iodine is found abundantly in their milk. The
elimination of its salts and the waste products through the skin produces irritation and often pustulation. In medicinal doses iodine increases the appetite, especially if there be an excess of acid; it promotes digestion and stimulates the absorption of nutritive material. Because of its insolubility, the
uncombined agent is seldom given internally, but generally in the form of
one of its compounds.

Therapy—In the form of an inhalation, iodine is of much benefit in disease of the nose, throat and bronchi. The influence upon the mucosa of
these passages is direct. Ulceration, with a watery discharge and a feeling
of fullness in the head, across the face and eyes, often inducing frontal
headache, is relieved by these inhalations.

Vaporized iodine is proving more effectual and immediate than applications of any solution.

In chest troubles following measles, these inhalations are somewhat
beneficial; also in irritation of the trachea or larynx, of either an acute or
chronic character, especially in children, evidenced by a hoarse, hollow, dry
cough, or wheezing respiration, induced by slight exposure to cold.

In conditions where there is an exceedingly free expectoration, especially if this has a bad taste or odor, as in some cases of bronchitis or
phthisis, and especially in purulent conditions following prolonged pneumonitis, inhalations of iodine have long been in use. A narrow-mouthed
pitcher may be filled with hot water, and on this may be dropped from
twenty minims to half a dram of the tincture of iodine. The vapor of this
should be inhaled directly for about five minutes, the head and the pitcher
being closely covered.

In 1911 Rouge of Paris advised the use of Iodine in the form of a vapor
for all external purposes and as an inhalant. He had found that when con-

verted into a vapor and applied to suppurating surfaces, or blown into abscesses, hydroceles, cysts, lymph nodes, tumors, etc., the immediate effect
was much more pronounced than when used by any other method.

More recently Dr. Capell of Omaha, Nebraska, has spent a great deal
of time and effort in developing this method, and the surprising results that
he has obtained have proven beyond doubt that the use of iodine vaporized
is superior to the application of the tincture or any other form of this
actively antiseptic agent.

In cases of acute infection, the vapor is thrown into the open wound and
applied over an infected limb or to the contiguous surfaces every day or
two. The influence is very prompt. He has invented a simple vaporizer
which makes the application of this vapor an exact and accurate process,
very readily handled. It is applied to ulcerations in the throat of all character, to post-nasal difficulties, especially the intractable ones, and to disease
of oe ae ear. This method will certainly become the future popular
metho:

Two of our writers advise the use of iodine in inflamed conditions of the
joints whether or not the inflammation involves the osseous structures, as well
as the synovial membranes. It may be given in small doses internally and
applied externally.

Dr. Aylesworth dissolves iodine in goose oil and applies it in preference
to the ordinary tincture. When the oil is boiled it takes up about eight per
cent of the iodine. This does not irritate, leaves no stain, and is promptly
absorbed.

Veterinarians depend greatly upon inhalations of iodine in their treatment of catarrhs, distempers and persistent discharges from the nasal mucous membranes of horses.

TINCTURE OF IODINE.

Occurrence—Prepared by dissolving two ounces and two hundred and
fifty grains avoirdupois of iodine in thirty-three fluid ounces and three
hundred and ninety minims of alcohol.

Physiological Action—Applied to the skin this preparation produces a
local inflammation following a primary irritation. It separates the cuticle
from the dermis slowly with only desquamation, or immediately, with the
production of a blister which contains serum. The application often causes
much pain, some patients being especially sensitive to it. In order to derive
benefit from the application of iodine, the soreness that exists must be found
in the deep muscular structures or in the parenchyma of the organ or gland,
since if the soreness is in the skin only it is apt to be increased by the
application, in which case belladonna applied will be found curative.

The tincture of iodine is applicable to enlarged glands, in goitre and in
scrofulous tumors, and in hydrocele. It is beneficial in enlargment and in
congestion of the ovaries with pain, and is useful in erysipelas, applied over
and beyond the inflamed area. In this form the agent is not usually given
internally because of its easy precipitation and lack of absorption. The skin
is painted with the full strength tincture once each day, or once in two or
three days for a short time only.

Therapy—It has been applied with good results in acute inflammation
of the lungs, and in pleuritis, bronchitis and phthisis. It may be applied
over the spinal ganglia in spinal irritation. At one time it was common practice to inject iodine into glandular structures, into bronchoceles, into the
tonsils, into abscess cavities and tumors and into malignant growths, but

this course is not now generally adopted. It is applied to bubos in the developing stage, and if the inflammation is not too far advanced produces
rapid abatement of the symptoms. At one time it was applied to the internal lining of the womb in chronic sub-involution or chronic metritis, but
although still advocated by a few it is replaced by as effectual and less
severe measures. If the compound solution is diluted with water it may be
used as a vaginal douche, in leucorrhea and in some cases of thickening of
the os uteri or simple ulceration.

In chilblains the tincture of iodine carefully applied is rapidly curative,
but is best applied in a diluted form, or rubbed up with an ointment base.
The tincture may be applied in tinea tonsurans, in tinea circinata and in
other parasitic skin disorders. It is not always best applied in full strength,
but may be thoroughly mixed with a bland oil, vaseline or lanolin. The
application of iodine to the gums is advised in cases where the teeth loosen
and the gums retract, especially in the aged. A colorless aqueous solution
made by dissolving one grain with two grains of the iodide of potassium in
an ounce of water will be found an-excellent form for this purpose. This
may be painted freely on the gums twice daily. It will also remove tartar.

The use of iodine if applied to the tonsils, crowded down deep between
the follicles into the crypts is very satisfactory treatment for tonsilitis. In
mild cases, it should be diluted with equal parts of glycerine. In all infectious throat troubles, the application of iodine is satisfactory.

The Compound tincture of Iodine (U. S. P., 1870) is made by dissolving
half an ounce of iodine crystals and one ounce of potassium iodide in one
pint of alcohol. The Compound solution of Iodine (Lugol’s Solution, U. S.
P. 1890) is made by dissolving seventy-seven grains of iodine and one hundred and fifty-four grains of iodide of potassium in three ounces and two
hundred and thirty-one grains of distilled water.

Either of these solutions may be given in doses of five minims three or
four times daily, freely diluted with sweetened water. The Decolorized tincture internally is absorbed without precipitation. It may also be painted
freely over the surface of the skin, with results similar to those of the tincture of iodine, without producing irritation. The tincture must be applied
if the irritant effect is desired. These preparations were at one time in
common use when iodine was desired. They are serviceable and active
therapeutically and while not commonly prescribed may well be described

ere.

POTASSIL IODIDUM.
Formula—KI1.

Synonyms—Kalium Iodatum, Potassium Iodide, Iodide of Potassium.

Administration—It is given in doses of from one to twenty grains in
solution in water or syrup. In patients not accustomed to its use, the desired
results may at first be fully obtained by the minimum dose. Especial susceptibility is shown by the appearance of soreness of the throat or nose, or
other evidences named under iodism.

Physiological Action—This salt is so readily eliminated through the
saliva that it is almost constantly tasted after it has been taken a short
time. It is readily absorbed into the blood where it is claimed that all
iodides are changed into the iodide of sodium, although there is much to disprove such a conclusion.

The general influence of the iodides is similar to that of iodine. They
depress the functions of the organs of the body, encourage destructive
metamorphosis and rapid elimination of morbific products, and retard con-

IODINE AND ITS COMPOUNDS, ETC. 423

structive metamorphosis. While they thus encourage elimination their
action may easily be carried so far as to produce a deleterious influence upon
the blood and its corpuscles. They deprive the blood both of fibrin and albumin, and prevent oxidation, and restoration of muscular tissue and other
structures. One great advantage the iodides have over many inorganic remedies is that they are very freely eliminated from the system by all emunctories. It is usually from their use in large doses that they are found in the
system and produce unpleasant effects. As confidence is gained in vegetable
alteratives, these among practitioners of rational medicine are usually prescribed, instead of the iodides or other inorganic alteratives.

Echinacea promotes even more rapid removal of morbific products than
iodine, and at the same time stimulates constructive metamorphosis, improves the blood, increases the number of its red corpuscles, adds tone and
vital power to the nervous system, thus increasing the functional activity of
all organs. However true these statements may be, we have by no means advanced to the point where we can entirely replace iodine and its compounds
with vegetable remedies.

Specific Symptomatology—Potassium iodide is especially indicated when
there is a pale leaden color of the mucous membranes of the mouth and
tongue, as its influence under these circumstances is more speedily apparent.
It will not act well if there is irritation of these mucous membranes, or of
those of the stomach and intestinal canal, as shown by a narrow, pointed, red
tongue with thin edges. Its prolonged use has produced oxaluria, albuminuria and also Bright’s disease, in which its elimination by the kidneys
is greatly retarded. It is demanded in blood dyscrasias, such as syphilis,
scrofula and chronic glandular inflammation with enlargement and induration.

Therapy—When cachexia of any character is present this salt is an important remedy. In the treatment of chronic enlargements of glands, or
organs, it is first thought of, the glands concerned in elimination being first
influenced. In goitre, in bronchocele, in enlarged lymphatic glands, it has
long been used and has come to occupy a permanent place in the therapeutics
of such conditions. It should be avoided, however, if there is a breaking
down of the structure of the gland with pus formation, as the sloughing
process is apt to increase, and is more difficult of cure while this agent is
used. Its use in the treatment of enlarged thyroid or of exophthalmic goitre
is attended with some degree of danger, especially if used both externally
and internally at the same time, as the blood may not be able to eliminate
the great amount of waste material thrown into it until serious damage is
done. This occurred under the indirect observation of the author, where the
circumference of a greatly enlarged thyroid was reduced seven inches in
three weeks. The elimination must be encouraged by all possible auxiliary
measures, in order to avoid this danger.

Chronic enlargement of the spleen or liver is directly influenced by this
agent. It is advised in the chronic malarial poisoning to which these enlargements are often due. If there is functional derangement of these organs the agent is of especial value, as it is believed to encourage a flow of
the bile and correct catarrhal conditions of the common duct. Iodide of
ammonium is in some cases more efficacious than the iodide of potassium
when these conditions exist..

In the treatment of syphilis potassium iodide is an acknowledged specific among all schools of physicians. It is advised in those cases which are
slow of development with gradually progressive phenomena, and is especially the remedy for the secondary and tertiary stages of the disease. It
was used by the older physicians in large doses long continued. The fact

## Page 417

“ 424 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

that large doses can be well borne by those not habituated to the remedy,
is considered as proof of the extent and severity of the syphilitic infection,
the amount that can be borne, being to a certain degree an index of the
extent of the infection.

All syphilitic disorders of the nervous system demand this remedy.
These are neuralgias, meningitis, paralysis, epilepsy, mental aberration,
sclerosis of the spinal cord, and all conditions resulting from the deposit of
nodes and gummata. It has also been used in spina bifida. It can hardly be
said to have a direct action upon the nervous system, but it removes the
causes of disease and stimulates the removal of waste, thus indirectly encouraging nutrition. It is advantageous when nodules are thought to have
formed upon the membranes of the brain.

In the following conditions depending upon syphilitic taint this agent
is accredited with specific properties: Skin eruptions of whatever character, syphilitic iritis, periostitis, nodular conditions and gummata, in all of
which this agent is usually the first remedy prescribed. In all forms of
disease of the bones from syphilis, especially if there are nodes, or enlargements, and in tubercular or other joint diseases, this agent is of first importance. In small doses, frequently repeated during the day, it is a specific for pains of an irregular character occurring from no apparent cause, in
the bones or muscular structures, during the night—nocturnal pains, especially if there be a syphilitic diathesis.

Dr. Eisenstedt gives from one to three drops of Fowler’s Solution of
arsenic with each dose of potassium iodide when large doses of this must be
given for skin diseases, and this prevents soreness or irritation of the
mucous membranes or of the skin in elimination.

Potassium iodide has exercised a most beneficial influence in many
cases, in the treatment of diphtheria. It is usually given in small doses,
which are often repeated, and a solution of tthe salt alone, or a solution of
the salt to which is added one-half as much iodine, is used as a gargle,
properly diluted.

This iodide is credited with much power in the removal of effusions following active inflammation, and also in the removal of the indurations present as the result of inflammation, and in the softening of inflammatory deposits. It is given after pleuritis, and in the latter stages of pneumonitis to
overcome hepatization and to elimnate or stimulate the reabsorption of inflammatory products. This effect is produced fully as satisfactorily in nonsyphilitic as in syphilitic cases.

Iodide of potassium is probably the most popular of remedies in the
treatment of aneurism. Balfour, Huchard, Ringer, Roberts, Chuckerbutty,
Bartholow and many others speak of it in this condition with great positiveness. It relieves the pain most satisfactorily, and in some cases, usually
the more recent ones, the tumor is slowly reduced in size and its pulstations
are rendered less conspicuous and less painful. The dose has been slowly
increased in quantity until more than two drams per day have been given
and have been well borne. In severe cases its use should be persisted in, as
a cessation of only a day or two is followed by increased pain.

In aneurism of the aorta its influence has been most satisfactory in relieving all pain, while firm thrombosis within the sac has occurred and the
pressure symptoms have been reduced.

While at a certain stage of Bright’s disease this agent will produce suppression of urine, in the earlier stages while the epithelial cells of the
glomeruli are yet intact, the potassium iodide will stimulate a greatly increased flow of urine, sometimes quite quickly relieving severe dropey. If the

IODINE AND ITS COMPOUNDS, ETC. 425

heart is involved it will greatly relieve the action of that organ. It has been
given in angina pectoris with good results in very many cases.

It is now but seldom that we have to treat mercurialism, a condition
that at one time was very common. In its treatment the iodide of potassium
was the principal agent used. In ptyalism it was used, as of first importance,
and in tremors, and in rheumatic or other pains caused by the use of this
agent, the iodide was commonly used. It was thought to increase salivation
in some cases and to cause the reappearance of mercurialization after the
phenomena had once disappeared. Ringer explains this phenomenon by the
theory that the iodide causes the insoluble albumin compounds of mercury
to set free the mercury in some soluble form, when it will act as before. It
is my opinion that the mercury from these insoluble compounds, forms a
soluble iodide in its union with the iodine of the potassium salt, and the reiene is the characteristic action of this soluble toxic mercuric
i e.

This agent is commonly used in the treatment of lead poisoning. It
stimulates the elimination of all metals, probably by combining with them
to form iodides, which are more easily eliminated. As a remedy for the removal of any metallic substance it should be given in small doses, that the
process of the conversion of the metal into a soluble iodide may not be too
rapidly hastened. Efforts should be constantly made to remove the metallic
iodide from the system as rapidly as it is formed, that none may accumulate
to cause the recurrence of the symptoms of the poisoning by the metal. The
solution of potassium iodide applied to tender areas, especially if from congestion or acute inflammation of a serous membrane, as in pleuritis or in
peritonitis, is often of much value. It acts best if diluted and applied hot
in such cases. It is also valuable when applied to enlarged and inflamed
glands, and to hardened, sore or tender muscles, or to inflamed portions of
muscular structure, also to bruised or strained joints, and to rheumatic or
tubercular arthritis or synovitis.

Iodide of potassium in five grain doses, three times a day given to patients who have suffered from deep and severe wounds will at times materially assist in the healing of those wounds.

SODIUM IODIDUM.

Formula—Nal.

Synonyms—Natrium Iodatum, Iodide of Sodium.

Occurrence—The iodide of sodium is prepared from a solution of caustic
soda in a manner similar to that in which the potassium salt is produced
from caustic potassa.

Description—It occurs in the form of crystals, isomorphous with those
of the potassium salt, and has similar but less active properties, but is more
soluble, however. Dose, from one to twenty grains in water or syrup.

Physiological Action—Its influence upon the system is similar to that of
the potassium iodide, but milder. It has but little irritating influence
upon the stomach and intestinal canal, and is almost entirely devoid of any
depressing effect upon the heart. It is really preferable in every condition
to the potassium salt, as it yields up its iodine much more readily, but the
potassium salt has been longer in use and has the experience of the mass of
the profession to confirm its influence.

Therapy—The therapeutic action of sodium iodide is fully considered
under that of the potassium salt.

PERRI IODIDUM.

Synonyms—Ferrous Iodide, Ferrum Jodatum, Iodide of Iron.
The syrup of the ferrous iodide is of a pale-green color and is quite
palatable. It is subject to decomposition on long standng, turning to a deepred color. It is given in doses of from fifteen drops to a dram, about thirty
minims being the proper dose for continued administration.

Physiological Action—The agent is an alterative tonic. It possesses the
properties of iron more prominently than those of the iodine. It stimulates the action of the stomach, improving both digestion and assimilation. It
stimulates peristaltic action of the bowels, acting in some cases as a laxative,
with blackened stools, instead of as an astringent as other iron salts. It is an
intestinal antiseptic.

Therapy—When there is scrofula or a mild syphilitic taint, with anemia
or impoverished blood, this is the remedy. It is demanded under these circumstances when there are scrofulous enlargements of any of the glands,
when there is obstruction from a dyscrasia or inactivity of the visceral
organs.

In the disorders of females suffering from the effects of scrofula,
syphilis or tubercular disease, this agent is exceedingly valuable. It is prescribed with success in chlorosis, overcoming the dyscrasia and improving
the condition of the blood.

In the amenorrhea common to anemic and chlorotic patients, this
agent acts directly. It improves the blood and stimulates or encourages a
normal return of the function, but does not induce a return before the
system can stand the drain. In leucorrhea and other disorders of a general
atonic character, it is valuable, especially if any dyscrasia is present.

It has long been used as an auxiliary remedy in phthisis pulmonalis, and
in all tubercular diseases of the joints, bones and skin. It is excellent taken
in conjunction with cod-liver oil and other restorative agents, and with
tonics,

ACIDUM HYDRIODICUM.

Pormula—HI.

The Syrup of Hydriodic Acid contains one per cent of the absolute
acid. Dose, from five to twenty minims.

Therapy—The agent is indicated whenever iodine is indicated and is
especially adapted to those cases in which an alterative is needed, in which
there are the usual indications for an acid. It liberates its iodine freely
within the system in the nascent form. It is thus active in strumous cases
of whatever character. It is useful in such cases as a restorative, when
there is catarrhal bronchitis or pneumonitis.

It is especially useful in scrofulous skin disorders, and has been widely
used under these circumstances.

In old standing gouty and rheumatic cases with deposits about the
joints, its persistent use has produced good results. It produces the greatest
satisfaction when the indications for an acid are present.

OLEUM MORRHUZ.
Synonym—Cod-liver oil.
Constituents—It contains butyric, oleic, acetic and sulphuric acids and
glycerine, salts of magnesium and calcium, and in addition iodine, bromine
and phosphorus in considerable quantities.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 420

IODINE AND ITS COMPOUNDS, ETC. 427

Administration—A tablespoonful four times daily is the adult dose.
Mixed with syrup of orange-peel, or aromatic syrup, or elixir, its taste is
partially concealed. It may be given in hot coffee, milk, brandy, wine or
whisky. Sometimes a little salt added to it covers its taste. It is also given
in the froth of porter, or of an egg, well beaten. If two hundred parts of this
oil are rubbed thoroughly with one part of the oil of bitter almond, the taste
is most effectually concealed; or equal parts of the oil and bitter almond
water may be shaken together in a large bottle, allowed to stand for a day
and then separated.

Physiological Action—In cod-liver oil the organic constituents are present in a vitalized form, hence the medicinal constituents are absorbed and
appropriated in a natural manner, in perfect harmony with all the vital
processes. It has nutritive properties of high value and at the same time is
an active alterative.

It is not well received by all stomachs, hence the necessity for the
preparation of palatable emulsions. It increases the appetite, improves the
quality of the blood and increases the number of red corpuscles. It increases
the power of the heart and the strength of the pulse, adding, at the same
time, to the general strength and weight. It materially assists in the elimination of morbific material—retrograde waste—from the blood, and exercises
a beneficial influence over scrofulous, syphilitic, tubercular and other
cachexie.,

Its common use in phthisis pulmonalis at once directs attention to it as
a cure for that condition. It must be begun early in the history of the
disorder, in which its influence is first upon the cachexia, and secondarily,
as a nutrient upon the general system. It has a beneficial action in chronic
diseases of the respiratory apparatus, but when directly from tubercular
or specific disease, the stomach must receive it readily, without great disgust
or nausea, and its use must be persisted in, sometimes for many months.

In tubercular arthritis or scrofulous inflammations of the joints, its per.
sistent use is attended with the best results. In tabes mesenterica its i
ence is satisfactory, also in spinal or hip-joint disease, but to a limited extent,

In the treatment of rachitis and other scrofulous conditions of infancy
its influence is marked, especially if given persistently with other directly
indicated remedies. In greatly debilitated patients its influence is especially
apparent if there is predisposition to scrofula, under which circumstances it
may be administered by inunction. It should be thoroughly rubbed over the
abdomen, in the axille and groins, once or twice daily. Its odor is the principal objection to this method, but the results are extremely gratifying in
many cases.

GROUP VII.
Agents Acting Upon the Genitourinary Organs.


General Renal Stimulants.
AGRIMONY. TRITICUM. ERYNGIUM.
BUCHU. EPIGEAE, GALIUM.
UVA URSI. ALTHEA.
AGRIMONY. AGRIMONIA EUPATORIA.

Synonyms—Cockle burr, Stickwort.

ConstITUENTS—It contains a volatile oil and tannin.

PREPARATIONS—Pulverized leaves. Dose, one dram. Decoction. Dose, two
ounces. Tincture, from one fourth to one dram. Specific agrimony, from
one to forty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—Deep soreness or tenderness over the kidneys. Tenderness that seems to be due to irritability in the structure of the
kidney. Sharp cutting, deep-seated pain, with general distress in the lumbar
region. Pain extending from the lumbar region through to the umbilicus.
Inflammation of the kidneys, or bladder, with foul-smelling urine, containing a sediment when passed, accompanied with discoloration, and dirty
appearance of the skin. Renal congestion, general irritation of the urinary
organs. This agent should be given in that common and intractable condition, where there is dribbing of urine in elderly people, always present when
coughing or sneezing. Bronchial or pulmonary cough, where there are thick
and profuses secretions, is relieved by it.

Therapy—The older physicians spoke very highly of the action of this
remedy within the limits of the above indications. It is valuable in the
treatment of erysipelas and scrofulous affections. It inhibits excessive action
of the mucous membranes, giving tone to the mucous tissues. In chronic
bronchitis and asthma, and in the earlier stage of consumption, it was especially advised. All authors agree, however, that its influence is most direct
upon the kidneys, correcting imperfect elimination through these organs. It
corrects chronic inflammatory conditions, and relieves general irritability.
Excessive mucous discharges are promptly relieved by agrimony. The atonic
and relaxed mucous membranes which secrete excessively, are restored to
normal tone and normal functional activity by its use. Bronchorrhea and
leucorrheea, chronic ulcerative gastric catarrh, as well as colitis, ileocolitis
proctitis and cystitis, all come within the range of its influence.

In ulcerative stomatitis, with foul smelling breath, it may be used alone
or in conjunction with astringent alteratives, as quercus alba, alnus or
geranium.

Agrimony is useful in a form of dysuria which affects women and girls,
especially those who are suffering from some form of dysmenorrhea; or those
in which there is difficulty in having a normal menstrual function established,
this function being accompanied with much pain and general distressing
symptoms.

RENAL STIMULANTS 429

With this there is often an irritable condition of the bladder. At the
same time there may be hysterical symptoms, which result from uterine or
ovarian congestion, which on its part, may be increased by the urinary irritation. This remedy seems to soothe the nervous system while it quiets the local
irritation of the bladder. It was used by the older physicians for this purpose.
Pain due to chronic renal or cystic inflammation is relieved by it through its
direct influence upon the pathological processes. There must be more general
observation of the action of this remedy, as it certainly possesses important
properties.

We would be inclined to combine macrotys or gelsemium and pulsatilla
with agrimony, but the old doctors believed the latter remedy would cover
the entire group of symptoms. However, a combination of the above agents,
properly adjusted, could not fail to be of service.

BETULINA.
BUOCHU. BAROSMA { CRENULATA.
SERRATIFOLIA.

ConstITUENTS—Volatile oil, rutin, resin, gum, albumen.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Buchu Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Buchu. Dose,
from ten to sixty minims.

Therapy—tThe agent acts directly upon the urinary apparatus, stimulating the kidneys, and increasing both the watery and solid constituents by its
tonic and restorative influence. It is also valuable when there is greatly
increased action from debility, as it lessens the quantity of water secreted
in such cases. It relieves irritation of the bladder and urethra, and is valuable in catarrh of the bladder, pyelitis and gonorrhea. In chronic cases of
irritable bladder it has long been used, especially if caused by persistent
excess of uric acid. It controls the irritation, reduces the excess of acid, and
relieves the urinary incontinence depending upon it. It relieves irritation of
the bladder sphincter, increases the tone of the muscular structure and overcomes any existing paralysis.

It has been advised as a general tonic, a stomachic and an anti-dyspeptic,
but we would hardly depend upon it for any positive curative influence in
these cases.

UVA URSI. ARCTOSTAPHYLOS UVA URSI.

Synonym—Bearberry.

ConstITUENTs—Gallic acid, tannin, Tesin, sugar, arbutin, ericalin.

PreparaTions—Extractum uve ursi fluidum, fluid extract of uva ursi.
Dose, from ten to sixty minims.

Physio! logical Action—Uva ursi has long been in general use as a diuretic
and sedative to the general urinary apparatus. It exercises both an astringent
and tonic influence also, and it is prescribed when there are calculi present.

Specific Symptomatology—Its direct influence is upon relaxed conditions
of the bladder walls, to which it imparts tone and induces normal contraction.
It restrains excessive mucous discharges.

Therapy—lIt is curative in ulceration of the bladder wall, in cystitis, in
pyelitis and in pyelonephritis. It is of much benefit also in the general treatment of gonorrhea. It has been prescribed with much confidence in diabetes,
in which condition its influence is more general than specific. It exercises

## Page 423

430 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

a soothing influence upon the urinary apparatus, and for that reason, is a
common constituent of very many prescriptions for diseased conditions of
this apparatus.

TRITICUM. TRITICUM REPENS.
AGRAPYRUM REPENS.

Synonym—Couch grass.

ConsTITUENTS—Triticin, silica, glucose, inosite, mucilage.

PrepaRATIoNs—Specifie triticum. Dose, from one to sixty minims.

Physiological Action—The action of this agent is solely upon the urinary
apparatus. It exercises a soothing, diuretic influence, greatly increasing the
flow of the watery portion of the urine without to the same extent influencing the actual renal secretion. It is bland, mild, unirritating, and is used
whenever urine, having a high specific gravity, causes irritation of the
kidneys or bladder, more especially of their mucous surfaces.

Therapy—It is a useful agent in pyelitis and in catarrhal and purulent
cystitis. It is of value also because of its soothing properties in gonorrhea.
In the treatment of lithzmia, it will relieve the constant ache in the back,
which is due to precipitation of the crystalline secreted products within the
tubules of the kidneys, by furnishing abundant water for their solution. It
flushes the kidneys, as it were, to an admirable extent, when renal sand has
accumulated within the pelvis. Under these circumstances it is one of our
most useful remedies. Whether the deposit consists of phosphates, uric acid,
or the salts of calcium, it seems to act equally well. It relieves dysuria and
tenesmus and has been beneficial in the treatment of both sub-acute and
chronic prostatitis with enlargement, strangury and hematuria.

In gout, chronic rheumatism and jaundice with the above complications,
it is of much value as an eliminant. One of our authorities speaks of it as a
drink in fevers. The infusion may be iced, or given with lemon juice as
lemonade.

It not only quiets the thirst, but it accomplishes the important purpose
of keeping up free secretion from the kidneys. In the treatment of fever it is
most important that the excretory functions should not be retarded and it
is but seldom that sufficient attention is paid to the function of the kidneys.
A free flow of urine is often a most effectual sedative, materially assisting in
the reduction of excessive temperature. There are but seldom, unpleasant
effects observed from mild stimulation of the kidneys, under these circumstances. It assists in the elimination of heat, and waste products, and greatly
lessens the danger of auto-intoxication, acting more effectually in many cases,
than free evacuation of the bowels.

While the demulcent effect of this agent is not as great as that of other
diuretics, its influence under the circumstances above named is often more
satisfactory.

EPIGZA. EPIGZA REPENS.

Synonym—Trailing Arbutus.

ConstiTvENTs—Arbutin, urson, ericolin (identical with those found in uva
ursa), formic acid, gallic acid, tannin.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Epigea Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Trailing
Arbutus. Dose, from thirty to sixty minims. Specific Epigea. Dose, from
five to thirty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—This agent should be freely employed where
there is excess of uric acid; where the ‘‘brick dust’’ deposit is marked; where
the extreme and nauseating backache suggests that the crystalline constitu-

RENAL SEDATIVES 481

ents of the urine are not well dissolved and washed out of the tubules; or
where there is renal sand or gravel in the bladder; where the urine is dark
and heavy, and there is irritation, causing congestion of the kidneys, which
in some cases induces hemorrhage; where precipitated solids irritate the bladder, and induce cystitis with thickening of the walls, and formation of pus.
An infusion of epigea freely drunk in these cases will relieve the entire train
of symptoms, inducing a grateful sense of relief from irritation and distress.

Any of the preparations in sufficient doses will accomplish satisfactory
results in the above conditions, but the infusion is more immediately active.
Fifteen drops of specific Epigea in an ounce of hot water, drunk hot, will act
most promptly.

If the patient is closely confined and constipated, with dark, sallow skin,
and inactive liver, add thirty grains of sodium phosphate and note the most
gratifying results. This latter agent is itself a renal tonic and stimulant,
with a soothing action. Its specific influence upon the liver greatly facilitates
its effects on the kidneys when there is a fault in the hepatic conversion of
the nitrogenous waste. In addition to its influence upon the kidneys,
epigea is a carminative of much value. It is a stomach tonic, and it
soothes gastric irritation. It will quickly relieve persistent eructations
of gas, and will cure many chronic cases that have resisted other treatment.
When there is noisy rumbling in the bowels so distressing to ladies, when
present, this agent may be successfully administered.

ALTHZA. ALTHZA OFFICINALIS.

Synonym—Marshmallow.

Solvent, water. Dose, from a half to one dram.

ConstITuENTs—Asparagin, mucilage, pictin, fixed oil, sugar, starch, salts.

PrePaRATIONS—Syrupus Althea. Syrup of Althea. Dose, ad libitum.

Physiological Action—Althea is the most mucilaginous of the diuretics.
It has but little influence beyond its local, soothing, emollient effect; it- also
soothes irritation in the mucous membranes of the stomach and intestinal
canal, as well as those of the entire urinary apparatus.

Therapy—In its soothing influence upon the intestinal structures, it is of
service when there is inflammation of the bowels or irritation from any cause,
and it is often administered as an enema in dysentery, and if a few drops of
laudanum be added it will often cause prompt relief from the tenesmus and
general distress. When irritation of the bladder exists from decomposed
urine, this agent is of much service, especially if taken in conjunction with
benzoic acid or benzoate of sodium. An infusion which contains five or six
grains of the above salts to the ounce is of most excellent service in these
cases. Acute painful cystitis with much mucus, ammoniacal urine, great pain
in urinating, and tenesmus, should be relieved in twelve hours with this
method.

In conditions where simple irritation is induced either from the presence
of uric acid or other precipitated crystalline bodies, a strong infusion of
Althea will greatly enhance the influence of other indicated remedies.

ERYNGIUM. ERYNGIUM AQUATICUM.

Synonym—Button Snakeroot.
Const1TUENT—V olatile oil.
PREPARATION—Specific Eryngium. Dose, from one to ten minims.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 425

432 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Physiological Action—Diuretic, diaphoretic, expectorant, emetic.

Specific Symptomatology—Irritation of the bladder and urethra, dysuria,
atonic dropsy, gravel, chronic nephritis, chronic bronchitis with profuse
expectoration, chronic gonorrhea, nymphomania and satyriasis, phthisis with
profuse expectoration, chronic laryngitis, mucous diarrhea and summer complaint, epidemic influenza, scrofulous ophthalmia, hemorrhoids and
prolapsus ani.

Therapy—Eryngium is a general stimulant, being diaphoretic and
diuretic, with a special affinity for the mucous membranes. It has been given
in infusion as a diaphoretic, in dropsy, gravel and jaundice, and in the commencing stage of catarrhal inflammation, such as occurs in the upper air
passages in epidemic influenza. It must be given early in acute cases as a
diaphoretic.

In chronic disease of the respiratory organs, with a relaxed condition of
the mucous membranes, it acts as a stimulating expectorant like senega.

It is especially valuable in chronic irritation and inflammation of the
mucous membranes; and on the urinary passages it has been shown to possess
specific powers, as in dysuria from stricture, and in gleet and chronic
gonorrhea.

It also acts as a tonic upon the reproductive function, and is a very positive remedy in nymphomania and satyriasis.

It may be given as a tonic in cases of weak digestion, and to promote
the appetite in general debility, and in convalescence from fevers.

GALIUM. GALIUM APARINE.

Synonym—Cleavers.

ConstiTvENTs—Gallotannic, citrie and rubichloric acids; starch.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Galium. Dose, from five to sixty minims.

Therapy—A sedative remedy in acute inflammation or irritation of the
urinary tract. Given in fever it impresses the temperature favorably, stimulates the excretion of all urinary constituents and ‘the fever is shortened by
its use. It is given for its general tonic influence upon the urinary tract.

An infusion is the most active form. It is useful in dysuria if from acute
inflammation, and it is an excellent remedy for suppression when nephritis
has occurred from septic causes. It is useful in strangury in vesical irritation
from uterine disorder and in the cystic and prostatic irritation of old men.

RENAL STIMULANTS 433

Therapy—aAn infusion of parsley is beneficial when, with nephritis or
cystitis, the specific gravity of the urine is high, and the urination painful
and irritating to the mucous membranes. It is useful in gonorrhea and strangury, with great irritation of the parts, with heat, or a scalding sensation on
passage of urine, and can be given during the inflammatory stage. It has also
been given in dropsy with good results.

Apiol is a specific in amenorrhea. Five or six minims in a capsule, three
times daily, for six or eight days before the menstrual epoch will restore the
flow in many stubborn cases. It has no marked abortive influence. In persistent dysmenorrhea it has cured many cases intractable to other agents.

Active anti-periodic properties have been ascribed to apiol. It is a-nerve
stimulant. It controls excessive night sweats, either from phthisis, or following protracted malarial disease.

BLATTA. BLATTA ORIENTALIS.

Occurrence—This is the powder of the dried bodies of the common
cockroach,

ConstITUENTS—A native chemist separated an alkaloid which he called
antihydropen, which he believed to contain in a concentrated form all the
therapeutic properties of the remedy.

This has been a common remedy in Russia for dropsy. It produces an
immense flow of the urine. At the same time it also acts freely upon the skin
as a diaphoretic. It so influences the functional activity of the circulatory
organs, and of the kidneys, that the entire character of the urine is changed
and a normal condition obtained. It will reduce the quantity of albumen in
the urine, often very quickly. With children from five to ten grains are
given during the course of the day. From five to ten grains may be given
three times a day to an adult.

BETULA. BETULA ALBA.

Synonym—White Birch.

This agent has been quite extensively used in Europe from the time of
the Middle Ages. One of the old writers—Dragendorff—says the bark is
given in malarial fevers, in dropsy, gout, disease of the lungs; also in abscesses, and in skin diseases and itch, and where there is excessive sweating
of the feet. The juice or sap from the tree is used in kidney and bladder
trouble.

The following facts were furnished me by Dr. Isenburg of Hamburg,
Germany:

The bark contains betulin, a resinous substance, and betulalbin. The
bark of the black variety contains glucosides, gaultherin, and an essential oil.
Winternitz and Jenicke both recommend the remedy for its diuretic effect
and for its influence in dissolving kidney stones.

Winternitz made an infusion of the dried leaves in the preparation of
one part to six or eight parts of water by weight. Of this he would give from
four to six ounces at a dose for Albuminuria. He claimed that albumin
epithelial scales and casts would disappear entirely. The quantity of the
urine would increase to from six to ten times its bulk. Jenicke used it in
nephrolithiasis. In one case, a stone had been discovered in the kidney by an
X-ray. The urine was concentrated, sometimes bloody, contained pus cells,
and uric acid in large quantities with three and one-half per cent of albumin.

This tea reduced the quantity of albumin, relieved the pain, improved the
general health of the patient so that in twelve weeks’ time he was entirely

cured, the urine being normal. There has been passed from time to time with
the water tiny pieces of stone from the kidney. We have had reports from
a number of writers in this country concerning the action of this remedy in
a similar manner, and all confirm the observations made by the German
writers.

PAREIRA. PAREIRA BRAVA.

Synonyms—Pareira root, Pareira brava.

ConstITvENTs—Starch, gum, tannin, and a very small quantity of an alkaloid, which was first obtained in 1838, by Wiggers. Subsequently an alkaloid
has been obtained from the root which is thought to be identical with beberine
of the nectandra. This has been called pellosine.

PrREPARATIONS—The remedy is used in infusion; dose, from two to four
drams. The tincture of the bark and the fluid extract. The dose of the
tincture is from one to ten drops.

Specific Symptomatology—This remedy is of value in the treatment of
chronic diseases of the kidneys or bladder, where the urine is scanty, and
contains a large quantity of the earthy salts, or urates. Where with these
irritating substances there is ulceration of the kidneys or bladder.

Therapy—Irritation, frequent desire to urinate, and pain in the organs during urination are relieved by this remedy. It is thought to be useful, especially in chronic inflammations of the urinary passages.

Pyelitis, pyelonephritis, and cystitis, with large secretion of pus and
mucus are benefited by it. It should be used in mild infusion, in the treatment of phosphaturia, or the condition sometimes known as phosphatic
Le ng It is a good auxiliary remedy in the treatment of all forms of

emia,.

ANEMOPSIS. ANEMOPSIS CALIFORNICA.

Synonym—Yerba Del Manza.

This is highly valued by the native Indians of Southern California and
Mexico. The California observers have used it extensively.

The remedy possesses tonic astringent and antiseptic properties.

The dose of anemopsis specific medicine is from five to thirty drops. The
root is the part used in medicine.

It is a tonic not only to the gastro-intestinal tract, but also to the respiratory and renal organs. It has an aromatic warming and astringent taste, not
at all unpleasant. It seems to possess properties very much like those of
piper-methysticum, and it can be used in the same conditions, as a tonic; combined with very small doses of specific nux vomica it is very efficient. In
tuberculosis, it has repute among the natives, and especially in tuberculosis
with great weakness, and tendency to hemorrhage. If it be added to specific
medicine, lycopus, it will give good results.

For feebleness of the mucous membranes, with a tendency to breaking
down of the tissues, given internally and as far as possible applied locally,
it gives good results, In gonorrhea and such urinary troubles where cubebs
are given, anemopsis is good. In painful diarrhea and dysentery with
passages of blood and mucus, also in bad cases of typhoid, Dr. Oliver spoke
very highly of it. The doctor in these cases used it in decoction, and so prepared it can be given freely.

In bad bruises, in tibial ulcers, and also in syphilitic sores, it makes a
good local application.

Dr. Munk of Los Angeles uses it for some time in nasal catarrh. He adds
from ten to thirty drops of the fluid medicine to a two-ounce prescription,
consisting of glycerin, one dram, aqua dest to make two ounces. This is used
as a spray in the head and the throat every two to four hours. He has had
considerable success with it.

The specific indications for its use in catarrh are, ‘‘a full, stuffy sensation in the head and throat.’’

It is a mucous membrane remedy, and whenever we have cough with
expectoration, or wasting discharges from the bowels, or urinary tract, it is
indeed a good remedy. When using it locally, as in catarrh, be sure and give
it internally. The compound syrup of the hypophosphites makes a splendid
vehicle in which to administer it.

OXYDENDRON. OXYDENDRON ARBORIUM.

Synonyms—Sour wood, Sorrel tree, Elk tree.

PREPARATIONS—Pills are made of the solid extract containing from three to
six grains. Specific oxydendron, dose from one to twenty minims. The Wm.
S. Merrell Co. make a normal tincture of which from one to ten minims may
be given in water.

Specific Symptomatology—It is indicated where there is dropsy, especially in aged people, or general dropsical effusion, accompanied with loss of
vital tone. Also where there is deficient renal action, accompanied with
painful urination. Urinary irregularities of the aged.

Therapy—This agent has been used in dropsy in a few cases with
marked results. It is not only used in amasarca and ascites, but also in
pleuritic effusion, hydropericardium and hydrocele. It improves the general condition on which the dropsy depends, increasing the action of the
heart and arterial tension. Dr. A. W. Smith reports several cases in which
the general dropsy was relieved in a very short time. The remedy improved
the general nutrition in each of the cases and overcame difficult breathing
and increased the power of the heart.;

In the dropsy of the aged, that follows prostrating disease, oxydendron
is indicated. It is indicated where there is deficient renal action, especially
if there is some painful urination, and in the urinary irregularity of old
people. It is not easy to define that class of cases of dropsy in which it is
specific as in some it works beautifully and in others it is ineffective.

Dr. N. A. Graves says that where there is general edema from dropsy
of the heart, liver or kidneys—general dropsy—he has had good results.
He gives from twenty to thirty drops of the specific medicine every four
hours and could give even larger doses. He uses it with aralia occasionally.
Where there is dropsy of the serous cavities, he thinks it is not the best

Dr. Manley gives sour-wood with other remedies in the dropsy of diabetes,
and believes that it improves the general condition of the patient. One of
our doctors said his grandfather, an old botanic physician, gathered the
leaves and boiled them in water for three hours. He would then strain the
decoction and reduce the fluid until it was entirely evaporated. He would
roll it up in forms of pills and give one of them three or four times a day,
improving his cases of dropsy very generally.

This remedy is considered valuable in the treatment of prostatic disease,
chronic enlargement of the prostate, with irritation at the neck of the bladder, urinary irritation from other causes, especially the urinary difficulties
of the aged. It is a diuretic, more or less active in proportion to the size

of the dose. It promotes the absorption and elimination of dropsical effusions in a characteristic manner, especially those of the abdominal cavity.
Given to patients suffering from protracted fever, it will make a cooling and
pleasant drink, which promotes the elimination of all of the excretions and
restores secretion, Felter and Lloyd state that when a frequent desire to
urinate is accompanied with a burning pain at the urethral outlet, the urine
passed in drops and mixed with a little blood, it is an especially valuable

ALFALFA. MEDICAGO SATIVA.

Synonyms—aAlfalfa, Spanish Clover, California Clover, Lucerne.

Physiological Action—On taking large doses of an infusion of the
leaves of alfalfa as one would drink tea or coffee, there is a sensation of
warmth in the stomach with fullness of the blood vessels of the head. (A
sensation which gelsemium removes.) The stool early in the morning is
mushy, and dark green, much like after taking bismuth, but without pain
or tenesmus. <A large dose at night, other symptoms calling for it, produces
a@ good night’s rest and decreases any burning sensation on micturating as
seen in cases of early gonorrhea. The above are observations’ that were
made on ten men and five women who took this drug, alfalfa. They were
in usual good health and free from any organic trouble. Some took it for
two months, and some only for ten days to two weeks.

There is an increased secretion of the kidneys from this agent and in the
female, of the milk glands; increased peristaltic action of 'the bowels; increased appetite; increased assimilation of food, and increased weight. In
one case there was a disappearance of swelling of the milk glands. There
is a sensation of weight in the female genitalia with bearing down sensations. (In the males, the scrotum feels heavy and there is distress in the
spermatic cord as if strained. Neutralization of acid urine occurs with itching of the corona glandis, found in some cases of enlarged prostate.)

These observations were made by Dr. Ben A. Bradley of Hamlet, Ohio.

From the fact that alfalfa increases the flow of milk in cows while they
are yet gaining in flesh, Dr. Bradley gave the remedy freely to mothers who
were insufficiently nourished, and secreted but little milk, or milk devoid of
its nutritious properties, for the child.

In every case so administered, the patient showed a satisfactory increase
in flesh and strength. The digestive apparatus, whatever the disorder, assumed its normal function, and in some cases the patients took on a fair inerease in flesh.

He believes that a tea made of alfalfa will readily take the place of
ordinary tea and coffee, and as a beverage for certain periods, he has found
it to take away the taste for these commoner beverages and preserve an excellent condition of the stomach.

With one woman who in three previous births had had kidney complications with uremia, he preserved with this agent a normal condition of all
the functions through the pregnancy and labor.

He finds in Alfalfa a superlative restorative tonic, but it does not act
as a stimulant, after the manner of alcohol, cocaine or other habit-forming
drugs. It rejuvenates the whole system by increasing the strength, vim,
vigor, and vitality of the patient. In all cases, the ever-marked condition
calling for the remedy is despondency, along with loss of flesh, whether the
case is one of stomach trouble, such as indigestion, dyspepsia, general and
nervous debility, anemia, marasmus, loss of appetite and poor assimilation,
as shown by loss of flesh and constipation, with the always accompanying

condition, depression. Alfalfa, administered in the dose one or two drops in
a bottle of milk three times daily, is especially useful with bottle-fed babies.
One physician prescribed it where there was dropsical effusion, where the
kidneys were inactive, and the skin dry, and in every case so administered,
it gave satisfactory results.

In old men, it relieves prostatic irritation. It relieves irritable conditions of the urinary apparatus.

Dr. Houts cured backaches where the patient was passing a small quantity of urine with high specific gravity, especially where there were rheumatic indications, with much muscular aching with excessive quantity of
urates and uric acid.

Dr. Bradley reports one family where seven children had died at the age
of eighteen from some undefined disorder with great emaciation. The eighth
child, a daughter, exhibiting the same symptoms was kept on a tincture of
alfalfa seed fully saturated, ten drops four or five times a day. The condition disappeared, the patient increased in weight from 99 to 133 pounds, and
recovered her health.

In a concentrated form, this will be probably found nutritional, occupying in some particulars a position like that of avena, improving the functional action of the brain and spinal cord. We have introduced this remedy
here because it promises well for the future, and must not be overlooked.

PreparaTions—A fluid extract from the ear terminals of the common
field corn prepared when yet green. Dose, from one to two drams.

Specific Medicine Stigmata Maidis. Dose, from twenty drops to two
drams, in water.

Therapy—The agent is a diuretic and and demulcent. It apparently has
antiseptic properties, due probably to the presence of maizenic acid which
has a desirable influence in neutralizing excessive alkalinity of the urine,
and in the cure of phosphatic gravel.

It is of value in catarrhal cystitis, soothing, and neutralizing the strong
ammoniacal odor, and decreasing the mucous secretion. In lithemia it increases the flow of water, and decreases the excessive proportions of uric
acid and the urates. It is specific in relieving bladder irritation in these

In painful urination from any cause, it is beneficial, and is a good auxiliary in the treatment of gonorrhea. It influences all catarrhal conditions of
the urinary passages.

Dupont advised its use in dropsies due to heart disease. He says it reduces the oedema, and as the edema disappears there is a better regulation
of the blood supply throughout the system; the pulse beats more regularly,
the action of the heart is slower and the rhythm is improved. While this

fact is true, there is not much improvement in dyspnea, nor in the actual
condition of the heart when hypertrophy, contraction, or inefficiency are
present. The agent is well tolerated by all patients.

Dr. Pruitt of Arkansas in 1893 reported the use of a distilled extract of
Corn Husks in the treatment of malaria. He had observed its use in many
cases of chronic intermittent fever. In no case had he known it to fail in
giving relief to the entire train of symptoms, often intractable to other remedies. It controls the persistent temperature, quiets irritability of the stomach, regulates the action of the liver and kidneys and reduces enlarged
spleen. It has a mild, diuretic effect in many cases, relieving dropsical conditions not dependent upon actual kidney lesion.

Dr. Fledderman of Nebraska, following the above suggestions, treated a
boy who had long been having malarial fever. He secured some tablets from
a Homeopathic pharmacy that were made from a tincture of corn husk.
With this he cured the boy in a short time of the malarial condition. In
another case of chronic malaria with cerrhosis and dropsy with the same
remedy, and succeeded in relieving the condition in a few weeks, and in
curing the patient in a fairly reasonable time.

SCOPARIUS. OYTISUS SCOPARIUS.

ConstITUENTS—Scoparin, sparteine, volatile oil, fatty matter, wax, tannin,
mucilage, albumin, sugar.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Scoparii Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Scoparius.
Dose, from twenty to forty grains.

Physiological Action—Poisonous doses of sparteine cause sweating,
vomiting, dimness of vision, staggering gait, dizziness, a sense of weight in
the limbs, slowing of the pulse, convulsions, paralysis of the motor and respiratory centers, and death by asphyxia. The preparations of scoparius are
non-toxic.

Administration—The best form of the remedy is infusion, half an ounce
of broom tops to half a pint of boiling water, to be taken in divided doses in
twenty-four hours, till it acts on the kidneys or moves the bowels.

Therapy—Asthenic dropsies, dropsy with feebleness and loss of appetite, hydrothorax without inflammation, dropsy from heart disease. It has
cured diabetes mellitus..

It should not be given in acute kidney troubles, or in dropsy from disease of the liver or spleen.

in the urethra while urinating, constant desire to urinate, suppression of
urine, either partial or complete, burning distress or dull aching in the bladder, urine mixed with mucus, pain in the kidneys. It has been frequently
used in enormous distension of the limbs and body from dropsy. Also in intermittent fever, chills in the lumbar region, when there is violent shaking
with little perspiration, severe bone pains, frontal headache, weak, tired
feeling, paroxysms every other day, hectic fever with night sweats.

Eupatorium Purpureum is a remedy for the diseases of the uric acid
diathesis, irritation of the urinary tract being the chief symptom; while it
is a positive remedy where it is necessary to increase the flow of the urine.
It increases retrograde metamorphosis and eliminates the poison causing
rheumatism. It stimulates the female reproductive organs, and may be employed in fabor and as a tonic in chronic uterine disease. In intermittent
fever it has effected cures. It acts on the ganglionic system of nerves, and
may be given to improve digestion. It stimulates waste, and may be employed in any case where an alterative is required.

Dr. Andrews for many years has treated scarlet fever with gravel root.
He adds two drams of it to four ounces of water and gives a teaspoonful
every two, three, or four hours for its active influence in stimulating
excretion.

CUCURBITA. CUCURBITA CITRULLUS.

Synonym—Watermelon.

ConstITUENTs—Fixed oil, mucilage, sugar.

PREPARATION—Fluid Extract of Watermelon Seed. Dose, one dram.

Therapy—The juice of the fruit is a diuretic with many individuals,
producing a cooling sense of relief from heat or aching across the kidneys,
or throughout the urinary apparatus. The seeds in the form of an infusion
act promptly with children, relieving pain in the passage of urine and
stimulating the flow of water. When male infants ery with every urination
and the diaper is stained yellow, this remedy will correct the condition
promptly. In those conditions accompanied with a general sense of constriction, or backache from the passage of urates and phosphatic gravel, this remedy exercises a direct soothing influence, not only upon the renal organs,
but upon the bladder, especially when the irritation persists, warding off
subsequent inflammation. It is also very useful during the active stage of
cystitis..

SPIRITUS ASTHERIS NITROSI.: Synonyms—Spirit of nitrous ether. Spiritus nitri dulcis. Sweet spirit
of nitre.

‘When aged and exposed, it assumes an acid reaction. It mixes freely
with water and alcohol in ail proportions.

Administration—The dose of this remedy is from ten drops to one dram,
freely diluted with water. In childhood a small dose frequently repeated
will be more satisfactory.

Therapy—This agent is an anesthetic although not used for that purpose. Its common use is that of a stimulating diuretic and if the conditions
are favorable, it will produce the discharge of a very large quantity of
water. It is the domestic remedy for retention or suppression of urine in
children. If it be given with hot tea or with watermelon seed tea, it is of
value in mild dropsies. If the glands of the skin are active, the skin being

warm and moist, its diaphoretic influence may be greater than its diuretic
effects. The agent is antispasmodic and stimulant in continued fevers with
much prostration and nervous irritability. It may be given in fifteen or
twenty drop doses four times a day in water with very good results. It
soothes the irritation, reduces the temperature and encourages elimination.

It is a remedy for nervous irritation of the stomach with nausea and
flatulence.

Its diuretic influence is of advantage in certain forms of Bright’s disease, if there is congestion with deficiency of urinary secretion. It is of
temporary benefit only and its use can not be greatly prolonged.

It will relieve pain in urination in many cases, especially if there is an
alkaline reaction to the urine. It is of value in urethral spasm and in some
forms of spasmodic stricture.

Pain on urinaton in childhood in the larger proportion of cases will be
benefited by its use.

EQUISETUM. EQUISETUM HYEMALE.

Synonym—Scouring rush.

ConsTITUENTS—Silex, resin, wax, sugar, starch, salts, fixed oil.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Equisetum. Dose, from five to thirty minims.

Therapy—aA diuretic useful in suppression of urine from any cause.
Useful in dropsy and in lithemic conditions, where the urine is scanty, of
high specific gravity, and dark-colored. It is advised in hematuria, and is
of much service in both gonorrhea and gleet. In cases of irritable bladder
with much tenesmus, it is soothing in its influence. It is valuable in the
treatment of nocturnal incontinence of urine in children, and in incontinence
induced by cystic irritation.

An infusion made from the green stalks of the plant, is sometimes of
more service than other forms, a fact which is true of a large number of
diuretics.,

Some authorities have advised the powdered ashes of this agent in the
treatment of certain forms of acid dyspepsia. This influence is probably due
to the presence of the potassium or sodium hydrate, or their compounds, in
these ashes, and these substances are readily supplied from more available
sources,

Equisetum is used where there is suppression of urine or scanty urine,
or where there is irritability of the mucous surface of the urinary tract.
Boskowitz’ Review says that it has been found of value in prostatitis. It
should be given where there is stinging pain in the glands. There is pain at
the base of bladder and in the prostate, and there is irritability of the
nervous system. The dose is from five to ten drops.

Dr. Jedlicka of Wisconsin thinks that it influences morbid enlargements
within the urinary apparatus. It is primarily astringent, and tonic. He used
it in prostatic enlargements combined with salix nigra. He finds it to act
favorably also in gastric ulcer.

from five to twenty minims.

Oleum Cadinum—Oil of Cade. This is an empyreumatic oil obtained
from the wood of Juniperus Oxycedrus, a shrub resembling common juniper,
by dry distillation, and is a dark-colored, thick liquid with a tarry odor,
and a burning, bitter taste. Dose, from three to five drops.

Therapy—Juniper has long been in use as a general diuretic and soothing kidney remedy. It is indicated in feeble or aged patients with persistent
dragging or weight across the kidneys. In chronic disease it is especially
beneficial. In pyelitis pyelo-nephritis and cystitis, all of a chronic form, it
is of value.

It will quickly relieve many cases of simple rena] hyperemia, preventing the development of structural change, or the advancement of nephritis.
After acute nephritis, whether from direct causes, or subsequent to scarlet
fever, diphtheria, or other severe disease, when active inflammation has subsided, it will restore the secretory power of the epithelium of the renal
tubules and readjust the secretory function to the blood pressure, restoring
normal action. It is useful in strangury, and in some dropsies where there
is absence of acute inflammation.

The oil of cade is applicable to skin diseases, especially moist eczema.
It may be applied directly, but is quite severe upon an irritable or sensitive
surface. It can be incorporated with an ointment base to excellent advantage. It is a useful agent in psoriasis, and as a parasiticide it will destroy
psora and cure favus.

It was at one time in common use as an application to skin diseases and
parasites in domestic animals.

442 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Physiological Action—Dr. David Cerna made extensive experiments
upon the action of the drug, which were published in The Therapeutic Gazette in January, 1891. His conclusions were as follows:

Kava-kava produces general anesthesia, and is an active local anesthetic, in that it diminishes, and finally destroys, the function of the afferent
nerves, by affecting their peripheral ends.

Kava-kava diminishes, and eventually abolishes, reflex action, by influencing the spinal cord, and probably also the sensory nerves. The paralysis
produced by Kava-kava is of spinal origin, and is due to direct action upon
the cord.

Kava-kava, while increasing the force of the heart, diminishes the number of pulsations, by stimulating the cardio-inhibitory centers and ganglia,
chiefly the former.

The drug lowers arterial pressure through an action upon the vagi. It
afterwards elevates it, however, especially after previous division of the
pneumogastrics, by a direct action on the heart.

Kava-kava at first stimulates, afterwards depresses and finally paralyzes,
the respiration. The primary stimulation is due to excitation of the pulmonary peripheries of the vagi; the latter effect, to an influence exercised
on the respiratory centers of the medulla oblongata.

Kava-kava, in small doses, increases slightly, and in large quantities
diminishes the bodily temperature.

The drug increases notably the salivary secretion.

Specific Symptomatology—Its specific therapeutic value depends upon
its influence upon the mucous membranes of the genito-urinary apparatus. It is profound in this influence, as it is probably eliminated by the
kidneys to a certain extent unchanged. Its influence in reducing the quantity
of blood in the capillary circulation is probably the cause of its action in
reducing the inflammation in the mucous membranes of this apparatus.
The writer has used it since 1882, and his experience confirms other enthusiastic reports. It will cure gleet where all other remedies have failed. It
will cure chronic gonorrhea more quickly and more satisfactorily than many
other better known remedies.

Therapy—tThe agent was first introduced for the treatment of all forms
of gonorrhea, but it will probably give better satisfaction, will show its
prompt influence to a better advantage in the treatment of sub-acute forms
or in the slow, persistent, and otherwise intractable forms, than in the acute
variety. It is best given in full doses of from fifteen to thirty minims every
two or three hours, in cold water. In the old, protracted gleety cases there
will be no necessity of an injection or auxiliary treatment, but in the more
acute or sub-acute cases, a mild injection or irrigation is needed, which with
auxiliary agents, such as gelsemium or macrotys, to act upon the fever and
nerve elements of the disease, will greatly facilitate its action.

It increases the tone and power of the sexual and urinary apparatus,
and improves the general health and vigor of the patient. It is a mild but
efficient diuretic, stimulating both the excretion and the secretion of the
urinary constituents. It is of much value in catarrh of the bladder, in old
and enfeebled cases relieving the symptoms promptly; in some cases restoring the strength and tone of the urinary organs. It relieves painful urination, overcomes strangury, and increases the power to expel the urine.

Morrill of Lincoln, Nebraska, is authority for the following statement
as to the uses of this remedy: It is specially indicated where there is atony
of the bladder, with a large quantity of residual urine, where the uric acid
diathesis is pronounced. In prostatic troubles of old men, where the urine
burns, and scalds, where there is hyperesthesia of the urethra and where the

testicles and scortum are pendulous, greatly relaxed and drag down upon the
cord, which is tender, where the masseteric reflex is pronouncedly diminished, and where there is soreness or tenderness in the perineum.

The agent should be given well diluted, although it is not unpleasant
in any vehicle. It will, however, derange the stomach, in some few cases,
although it soothes the stomach usually, and is an active stomachic tonic.

The doctor gives it as routine treatment in gonorrhea, in combination
with an alkali, usually the citrate of potash. In the treatment of urinary
disorders, he gives the following symptomatology; uneasy sensation in the
region of the bladder; an inclination to pull up or hold up the parts, and the
symptoms relieved by wearing a suspensory. Pain in the urethra extending
to the perineum, urine highly acid, causing smarting and burning, acute and
chronic cystitis, prostatitis, with hypertrophy, and epididymitis. Other conditions depending upon atony of the genito-urinary organs.

Dr. Cleary has treated several cases of intolerable itching of the vulva
with kava-kava one part, glycerine two parts, applying this freely. The results were very satisfactory. In a diabetic case, he obtained just as good results. I shall experiment with this for further local anesthetic effects.

I have recently had an experience in the treatment of an exaggerated
case of pruritus of the vulva and anus, which remained persistently after repeated poisoning from rhus tox had been finally cured. The patient avers
that an extemporaneous dilution made at my direction, of one part of kavakava in from two to six parts of water, as the occasion demanded, has been
an ideal application for immediate—almost instantaneous relief—when the
itching was unbearable. The nervous system had become so involved in this
case that nerve sedatives internally were demanded.

In the nocturnal enuresis of the aged and feeble, and in children from
temporary muscular weakness, it is a most satisfactory remedy, curing often
when other remedies fail. It acts in perfect harmony with belladonna and
strychnine in such cases,

Its diuretic influence has rendered it an important remedy in many cases
of dropsy, the entire train of symptoms being quickly and satisfactorily relieved with its use. In those cases where the heart seems feeble and irregular
in its action, its power and strength has increased and a cure resulted.

It increases the appetite actively, and improves digestion and assimilation to a satisfactory extent with a large percentage of the patients taking
it, and may be given for this purpose in gastric atonicity. In some cases, in
which the author has prescribed it, the agent has induced an almost inordinate appetite. It stimulates the entire function of digestion, in certain cases,
to a satisfactory degree, correcting torpidity and functional inactivity of the
glandular organs of the entire intestinal tract, increasing the peristaltic action
of the intestines, overcoming constipation, and inducing normal and satisfactory bowel movement. It is curative in intestinal catarrh and in
hemorrhoids.

Dr. Sherman, of Ohio, confirms the statements I have made, in previous
editions of this work, concerning the influence of kava-kava upon the stomach
and digestive apparatus, which I first observed in 1882, and adds to that the
benefit of his own experience in the treatment of intestinal indigestion.
There is a train of symptoms present when this condition has been of long
standing which is promptly met with kava-kava.

He gives the following symptoms as immediately benefited with this
remedy: There is scantiness and irregularity of the flow of urine, the patient’s face looks full, sometimes pale, all the tissues seem to be slightly
edematous, the feet and the legs more so than other tissues. The tongue is
full and pale, the bowels regular or slightly constipated, with loss of appe-

tite, and poor gastric or gastro-intestinal digestion. The patient feels
languid, claims that he must force himself to do anything, and presents many
of the appearances of Bright’s disease, and yet the analysis of urine fails to
find evidences of that disease. If this patient be put upon kava-kava, from
twenty to thirty drops in water, four times a day, an improvement of all
of the symptoms will be observed within the course of perhaps ten days.
ar improvement will continue until the patient is restored to perfect
ealth.

The agent will relieve cerebral hyperemia, arterial sclerosis, and hematogenous jaundice. It will be found valuable in atony of the intestinal
tract, especially if nervous phenomena seem to depend upon that condition.

The following is Dr. Morrill’s treatment for acute rheumatism: Kavakava five drams, macrotys three drams, citrate of potassium four drams,
elixir of pepsin, sufficient quantity to make four ounces. Give one dram well
diluted every three hours. If there is profuse sweating, he includes hyoscyamus, two drams in the prescription, instead of the citrate of potassium.
He wraps the joints in cotton, and insists upon rest in bed and an extreme
non-nitrogenous diet. He gives no salicylates in acute rheumatism. He
claims that this course will prevent all cardiac complications.

He believes much of the severity of the condition depends upon gastrointestinal faults, and these must have constant attention.

HYDRANGEA. HYDRANGEA ARBORESCENS.

Synonyms—Wild Hydrangea, Seven Barks.,

PrePaRaTION—Extract of Hydrangee Fluidum. Fluid Extract of
Hydrangea. Dose, from ten to thirty minims.

Specific Medicine Hydrangea—Dose, from five to thirty minims. Thirty
minims in two ounces of water, a teaspoonful every ten or fifteen minutes,
will quickly relieve acute, quick, cutting, urethral pains, especially immediately after labor.

Specific Symptomatology—Frequent urination with heat, burning, accompanied with quick, sharp, acute pains in the urethra; partial suppression
of urine with general irritation and aching or pain in the back, pain from the
passage of renal sand, are direct indications for this agent.

I am convinced after a lifetime of experience that it is more specifically,
more universally a sedative to pain and distress in the kidneys and urinary
bladder than any other one remedy.

Therapy—This agent is a soothing diuretic, exercising a mild, but permanent tonic influence upon the entire mucous structures of the genitourinary apparatus. It is an important remedy in acute nephritis. I have for
many years combined it with gelsemium, or gelsemium and macrotys, and
have obtained most satisfactory results. In lithemia with permanent backache from the kidneys, irritation from the presence of urie acid and phosphatic crystalline precipitates, the continued use of this agent is usually
curative. In urinary irritation of an acute character, or that induced by
local causes, as that following confinement, this agent is often curative in a
few hours. Any excess of acidity or alkalinity, however, should be corrected by other agents.

About the year 1830 experiments were conducted to prove its influence
in relieving pain caused by the presence and passage of urinary calculi, and
favorable reports were made of its direct usefulness. Its influence controlled
the pain in a satisfactory manner, relieved general distress, and soothed irritation. Enthusiasts claimed that it dissolved the stone in the bladder.

Infusions, in some cases, are more satisfactory than exact pharmaceutical preparations. The fluid extract in hot water is often more prompt
in its action. The agent is soothing, also, to the mucous surfaces of the respiratory passages.

PICHI. FABIANA IMBRICATA.

Part Employed—The leaves.

ConstTITUENTS—A fluorescent glucoside, crystalline; a crystalline neutral
resin, pavien, fraxin and an essential oil.

_PREPARATIONS—Extractum Pichi, Extract of Pichi. Dose, from two to ten

Extractum Pichi Fluidum. Fluid extract of Pichi. Dose, from ten to
sixty minims.

Administration—This agent being a terebinthinate and markedly resinous in character, readily precipitates in water, the precipitate separating in
masses or curds. The solid or powdered extract may be given in capsules.
The fluid extract may be prescribed in glycerine without precipitation. It
should not be combined with saline constituents. It can remain in temporary
suspension in a heavy syrup, or mucilage.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent has specific properties in relieving
irritation and inflammation of the bladder due to mechanical causes. In
gravel, especially of the uric acid variety, it is prompt and satisfactory. In
phosphatic or calcareous deposits, it is of great benefit.

This agent gives tone to the whole genito urinary tract. It is especially
valuable in cases where old people are troubled with inactivity of the kidneys with a tendency to feebleness of the muscular structure of the bladder.
It acts in those cases of gravel where the irritation is marked. It is thought
to assist in the disintegration of the stone until it is reduced so that it may
be passed through the urethra. The urine will assume the characteristic
odor of the drug, especially if it be given in overdoses. It may be given
with other common remedies of this character. Its best field is in those
cases of chronic inflammation of the kidneys or bladder, where there is a
persistent discharge of large quantities of blood, pus, mucous and calculi in
the urine. It should be given in full doses, from twenty to forty-five minims
of a strong fluid extract.

Therapy—lIt relieves general distress or discomfort in all the urinary
organs, and in the prostate gland. In vesical tenesmus and in dysuria from
any cause it is almost specific. In lithemia or the urid acid diathesis, it
stimulates the liver to more perfect action, greatly increases the action of
the kidneys, reduces the specific gravity of the urine, and permanently reduces the excess of uric acid. This influence renders it of value in rheumatism, either acute or chronic.

It has been used in gonorrhea and in acute and chronic cystitis of all
forms with excellent results. It acts as a gastric tonic, like kava-kava,
greatly increasing the appetite and promoting digestion. It has a direct
action upon the function of the liver.

It stimulates the kidneys, too actively in those cases where there is
structural degeneration, but it will quickly overcome simple recent cases of
renal hyperemia. It is coptra-indicated in Bright’s disease, as in some protracted cases the albumen has been increased by the use of this remedy.

It is also useful where there is biliary calculi, as well as in the renal
and vesicle forms. It allays urinary tenesmus, in those cases of cystitis,
which are of mechanical or traumatic origin. In acute urethritis it has accomplished some good results.

Fifteen minims of the fluid extract every three hours has proved serviceable in the treatment of acute prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, and in the
subsidiary stage of orchitis, and epididymitis. In some cases the remedy is
best given with an alkali. In those cases where the urine smells foully and
is alkaline in reaction, it may be given in conjunction with borax and benzoic acid, with excellent results. Some forms of painful disease of the pelvie organs have been relieved by it. It is useful in dysmenorrhea, and acts
in harmony with viburnum.

XANTHIUM. XANTHIUM SPINOSUM.

Synonyms—Cocklebur, Clotbur.

PreparRaTions—Extractum Xanthii Fluidum; Fluid Extract of Xanthium.
Dose, from ten to twenty minims.

Specific Medicine Xanthium. Dose, from five to fifteen minims.

Physiological Action—The agent has mild diuretic, diaphoretic and sialagogue properties. Xanthium is mentioned as a remedy influencing the
blood in malarial conditions, tending to overcome perodicity. As an alterative some enthusiastic writers give it high rank, even claiming that it will
cure hydrophobia. It is advised in hemorrhages of a passive character, to
be relied upon even in post-partum hemorrhage. In the writer’s hands it
has an influence which would seem to be advantageous in hematuria of a
passive character, as it has a soothing influence upon the urinary apparatus.

Therapy—Dr. Homsher suggested its use in irritable bladder troubles;
specifically in chronic cystitis, with thickening of the bladder walls, with
frequent urination, painful tenesmus, constant sensation of weight in the region of the bladder, with the continued passage of minute calculi, cases in
which there are doubtless sand or gravelly deposits in the folds of the bladder, perhaps imbedded in the mucous structure, a condition not uncommon in
emales,

ACIDUM BENZOICUM.

Synonym—Benzoic Acid.

Physiological Action—A solution taken into the stomach produces
warmth and slight irritation. It is nontoxic, is decomposed in the presence
of hippuric acid. It is of considerable power as an antiseptic and germacide.

This acid acts directly in neutralizing alkalinity throughout the system,
upon the urea in the processes of conversion of that substance into hippuric
acid, robbing it of its nitrogen. There is thus a reduction of the amount of
urea where this acid is administered in large quantity. If there is a lessened
quantity of uric acid it is because of the appropriation of nitrogen by the
benzoic acid, and not because of any solvent properties the agent has upon
the uric acid.

Therapy—Its direct action is exercised upon the urinary apparatus. It
is specifically indicated in conditions where the urine is alkaline, inducing
frequency of urination with more or less irritation and pain in nocturnal
enuresis.

It is a good remedy in excessive excretion of the phosphates exhibited by
phosphatic sediment—insoluble phosphates in the urine—a deposit of phosphatic gravel. Its influence is chemical and does not persist after the withdrawal of the agent. Incontinence of urine depending upon the irritation
caused by the presence of this gravel is cured by it.

RENAL CORRECTIVES 447

Incontinence in cases where the urine is excessively alkaline, from whatever cause, is quickly cured by it, as it is one of our best agents for the
neutralization of excessive alkalinity of the urine. It has been used by the
writer for nearly twenty-five years in the treatment of cystitis where there
was ammibniacal urine. Its influence is prompt and satisfactory, rapidly
promoting the processes of healing.

It is useful in gonorrhea where the urine is alkaline, and in general
urethral irritation from the presence of an excess of alkaline constituents.
It is readily dissolved by the addition of sodium borate, decomposing the
acid, but not interfering with, but rather enhancing the beneficial results of
its action. It requires three parts of the borate of sodium to effectually dissolve two parts of the acid in thirty parts of water.

SODIUM BENZOATE.

Therapy—Klebs, of Prague, originally advised this agent in infectious
fevers and inflammations. It produced no unpleasant after effects and antagonized the causes of disease and the disease processes. Its antiseptic
powers are sufficient to destroy many disease germs, and fevers so induced
slowly subside. Direct antipyretic powers cannot be attributed to it.

It was one time quite generally used in diphtheria, in scarlet fever and
other exanthematous or eruptive fevers, and in typhoid and malarial fevers
with much success. It is a good remedy in the treatment of rheumatism.
It combats the processes, neutralizes the uric acid wherever found, hastens
its excretion and abates the inflammatory fever. It promptly relieves irritation of the kidneys in these cases.

It is not as active as the salicylate of sodium, but is permanent in its
influence and almost as efficacious, if persisted in.

It is of value in catarrh of the bladder, either acute or chronic, if the
urine is strongly alkaline, or much mucus is present.

In line with this influence, I have in late years secured prompt and
highly satisfactory results from a Nascent Sodium Benzoate which is superior in its action to the stable drug. With old men, especially where
chronic catarrh of the bladder results in the discharge of a heavy sediment
of pus and blood, where there is constant urinary irritation with tenesmus,
the pain, in some cases being excruciating, and remaining after the unsatisfied effort has passed I have found this to be so prompt in its action as to
give almost complete relief in a few hours.

It is prepared by dissolving four drams of benzoic acid and six drams
of sodium borate in six ounces of boiling cinnamon water. When this cools,
the solution should be perfect, but if a little excess of the acid should remain undissolved, it may be filtered. Of this a tablespoonful is given every
two hours during the period of distress and pain. These two agents can be
compressed into tablets of correct dosage and dissolved in water as needed.

The atomization and inhalation of sodium benzoate is beneficial in catarrh, bronchial and phthisical fetid discharges, ameliorating, in each case,
the progress of the disease while correcting the fetor. It was lauded in the
treatment of consumption, but failed to accomplish but little. It is not now in
as general use as it was twenty years ago.

LITHIUM BENZOATE.

Therapy—This agent is accredited with the ability to reduce the amount
of uric acid excreted in the urine, by the actual reduction of the quantity in
the blood. It is said to retard, also, the formation of hepatic calculi, and to
prevent the recurrence of hepatic colic. If this influence is present it is
probably due to its action upon the secretory function of the liver. When
urinary irritation is present with hepatic colic, both conditions will be. benefited by the use of the remedy. Cystic irritation from the presence of renal
sand is materially benefited by the use of this benzoate. Ammoniaca] urine
will be corrected by its influence.

AMMONIUM BENZOATE.

Therapy—tThe benzoate of ammonium is principally used in catarrh of the
bladder. It is given largely for the influence of the benzoic acid with which
it is combined. It is especially indicated where there is alkaline urine. Because of the rapid elimination of the hippuric acid from the benzoic acid,
and because of the fact that the ammonium salt is convertible into nitric
acid within the system the elimination of these products neutralizes the
alkalinity of the urine. It is useful in ammoniacal urine and in phosphaturia
with precipitated earthy phosphates, also in excess of uric acid.

It stimulates the kidneys also in those conditions of the system in which
there is general feeblencss, resulting in deficient elimination, both of the
solids and watery portion of the urine.

The agent is not injurious in its effects upon the system and is easily
eliminated.

PIPERAZINE.

Formula—C,H,,N,.

Synonyms—Piperazidine. Diethylendiamine.

Administration—It absorbs water so rapidly and is so prone to decompose in solution that it should be prescribed in aqueous solution only and
should be prepared fresh every two or three days. The crystals should be
kept hermetically sealed in a cool place. Three grains every three hours, or
five grains three times daily, is about the proper dose, given in a glass of
water.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent is indicated where there is persistent, excessive excretion of uric acid and the urates with constant backache, dry skin and scanty urine, or where there is a brick dust sediment in
the urine. It is a good agent for the uric acid diathesis in many cases.

Therapy—tIn the writer’s experience when given in five grain doses in
a large quantity of water, three times daily, to patients passing urine with a
specific gravity of 1022 to 1028, which deposits a heavy brick dust precipitate
as soon as cooled, with constant backache and general muscular aching, it
will relieve the backache in one day, and reduce the specific gravity to 1018
or 1020 within a short time.

It acts more rapidly than other better known agents, and is direct and
positive. It is soothing to the irritated passages, and prevents the formation
of uric acid calculi. If given with a bland mucilaginous stimulating diuretic
its general influence is greatly widened, and its solvent powers are increased
correspondingly. The sickening ache across the kidneys terminates more
promptly.

RENAL ANTISEPTICS 449

The agent has been quite widely used in the treatment of chronic rheumatic arthritis, and gout, and good results are ascribed to it. It has been
applied in strong solution to the joints and injected into them with varying
results in these conditions, usually with favorable results. It is useful in
acute rheumatism and in rheumatic pericarditis, especially if there be excessive uric acid formation. Further experience should broaden its field of
usefulness,

HEXAMETHYLENAMINE.

Synonyms—Urotropine; uritone; helmetol (proprietary).

This compound is the result of a chemical action between ammonium
hydrate or formaldehyde. It is crystalline, colorless and odorless; dissolves
in one and one-half parts of water. The influence of the agent within the
system depends upon the fact that the formaldehyde is liberated and is dispersed throughout the entire system. It is found in the blood, in the spinal
fluids, and in all the secretions, especially in the urine.

It its influence upon the stomach is desired, it can be given in a erystalline form, as the normal gastric acids will produce the desired chemical
change. If its influence upon the intestinal tract or upon the bladder is desired, it must be given in some form in which the stomach acids will not immediately act upon it. The dose is from five to thirty grains, three times
ae in a little water. From five to fifteen grains is about the ordinary

osage.

Therapy—tThe agent acts directly upon any infections within the system
as would be inferred because of its invariable, active, antiseptic influence.
In its elimination, through all the secretory glands, it thus influences the
mucous membranes, and among the first of these are those of the urinary apparatus and bladder. Its first effect is thus seen in inflammation of the bladder or in pyelitis, where the urine is heavily charged with ammonium; where
there is an abundance of uric acid and amorphous urates, with triple phosphates and pus. Alkaline urine in the aged, seems to be its most conspicuous
indication.

Any irritation of the mucous membranes, either funetional or of the
glands themselves, is met with this agent. In typhoid fevers and in fact
in all forms of septic fevers, the agent is now being used with good results
because of this antiseptic action. It acts upon the mucous lining of the
gall bladder, and of the bile ducts as well, and upon the mucous surfaces
of the entire intestinal tract. In typhoid fever above referred to, if given
early, it destroys and prevents the action of the typhoid bacillus. Given
later to an extent it will destroy the germ within the system, and at the
same time promote normal functional action of the mucous glands and
restore their normal condition.

Urotropine has been found in the cerebro-spinal fluids persistently as
long as the agent is given. Because of this fact a number of prominent prescribers have used the remedy in the treatment of meningitis, especially that
of children with excellent results. It is regarded with much favor in poleomyelitus. It will certainly be advisable to try it in conjunction with our
vegetable anti-toxins and anti-spasmodics, such as echinacea, lobelia, and
gelsemium.

Synonym—Honey bee.

Preparations—Tincture of Apis. Dose, from one-half to five drops.
Specific Medicine Apis. A superior preparation, used by physicians generally;
administered from ten to twenty drops in four ounces of water, a teaspoonful every two to four hours.

Specific Symptomatology—Acute swelling—cdema of the cellular tis:
sues, local or general swelling, without the formation of vesicles; urinary
irritation from atony; incontinence from feebleness; retention from irritation,
with dark, heavy, scanty urine.

Therapy—The agent is prescribed in dropsy which appears suddenly. Old
standing dropsies are not so readily influenced by it. G&dema glottidis is subject to its influence, and it quickly relieves the edema of the throat and nasal
passages which accompany diphtheria and scarlet fever. It is also curative
in the dropsy, which follows these two closely related diseases, from sudden
suppression of urine. It influences the kidneys at the same time, causing an
increase of the urine; it soothes the irritability of these organs and relieves
the congestion present. When effusion from pleuritis, peritonitis, or other
acute serous inflammation, is present, it is given with confidence.

In retention and suppression of urine in children, and the aged, from
atonicity or general feebleness, it is a useful agent.

It is also useful in irritable bladder with teasing tenesmus, where the
urine is scanty and high colored, when micturition is frequent and accompanied by much soreness and burning.

In the urinary incontinence of the aged and feeble it is prompt in its

In doses of two drops of the specific apis four or five times daily, many
cases of passive hematuria intractable to other remedies, will yield promptly.

Apis has been used to excellent effect in angeoneurotic edema in a case
where the patient was threatened with death from asphyxiation, the difficulty
of breathing being very great. Five drops of the specific apis in four ounces
of water, a teaspoonful every ten minutes for an hour, then every hour, produced immediate effects.

It is especially useful for the dropsy following peritonitis, and pleurisy,
and will act directly if with the dropsy there is an entire absence of thirst.

ARALIA. ARALIA HISPIDA.

most serviceable extent. An infusion of aralia, given with other agents suggested for dropsy, will exercise a most immediate influence in the removal of
the fluid. In suppression of urine it is an unirritating stimulant of much
value. In gravel it is of some benefit, and may be given freely in combination
with remedies directly indicated for other existing conditions.

SWAMP MILKWEED. ASCLEPIAS INCARNATA.

Synonym—Flesh-colored Asclepias.

ConstiTuENts—Asclepiadin (the emetic principle), volatile oil, two acrid
resins, an alkaloid, fixed oil, albumen, pectin, starch, glucose.

PREPARATION—Specific Swamp Milkweed. Dose, from one to twenty minims.

Physiological Action—Emetic, diuretic, anthelmintic, stomachic. Swamp
milkweed affects the heart and arteries like digitalis, and is a speedy and
certain diuretic.

Specific Symptomatology—Asclepias Incarnata strengthens the heart and
is given in small doses, instead of digitalis, as a diuretic in dropsy. It often
promptly relieves the general distress from extreme infiltration of the tissues,
especially the dyspnea.

Therapy—It may be given in coughs and colds, rheumatism from cold,
painful stitches in the chest with threatened inflammation of the lungs and
pleura, asthma, chronic gastric catarrh, diarrhea, dysentery, dropsy, worms,
erysipelatous diseases.

It improves digestion, and is a good remedy in chronic catarrh of the
stomach, and in catarrhal inflammation of the respiratory organs.

It is both emetic and cathartic and may be used with advantage in the
early stages of dysentery and diarrhea.

In rheumatic and catarrhal inflammations it should be given to produce
slight nausea.

In doses of ten to twenty grains it acts as a vermifuge.

It is also beneficial as a local and internal remedy in erysipelas and
erysipelatous diseases.

SAMBUCUS. SAMBUCUS CANADENSIS.

Synonym—Elder

PREPARATIONS—Specific Sambucus. Dose, from two to ten drops.

Therapy—The strong infusion is diaphoretic and stimulating. The agent
has also alterative, cathartic and diuretic properties which are of value in
urinary inactivity, with excretion of renal sand, accompanied with muscular
aching, stiffness, or rheumatic pains.

A strong infusion is sometimes of great service in removing dropsical
effusions. Cases are reported in which extreme general dropsy seemed to
threaten immediate death, where relief was quickly and permanently obtained
by the use of this remedy.

HYGROPHILIA. HYGROPHILIA SPINOSA.

The above named agent is a native of Ceylon where it is used as a remedy

It is a powerful diuretic and is a stimulant and tonic to the sexual apparatus.

SOLIDAGO. SOLIDAGO ODORA.

Synonyms—Sweet golden rod, Fragrant leaved golden rod, Sweet-scented
golden rod, Blue mountain tea.

ConstTITUENTS—The plant contains a volatile oil.

PREPARATIONS—An infusion may be given in doses of one ounce. The oil
is given in from one to three drops. There is a homeopathic mother tincture.

Therapy—This agent has been used as a domestic remedy for backaches
and diseases of the kidneys for centuries in Germany. Radamacher spoke
highly of its properties. Homeopathic physicians prescribe it where there is
pain in the kidneys, from any cause, extending forward toward the abdomen.
Pain in circumscribed spots over the kidneys. Difficult and scanty urination,
where the urine is of dark color, and contains a heavy sediment. Where there
is nephritis, either acute or chronic. It is useful where there is suppression of
urine in infants, or retained urine, which causes general depression, with
headache. Urinary obstructions, from any character, in the early stage of
dropsy, depending upon kidney disease.

The oil is carminative, and may be given in flatulent colic, cramps or
pains in the stomach, from flatulency, with or without nausea.

In dysentery, diarrhea and in cholera morbus, an infusion or a few drops
of the oil in hot water, given in conjunction with other indicated remedies,
will be found of service. Hot infusions should be tried in amenorrhea, especially that form resulting from a cold of recent occurrence.

Therapy—The direct influence of this agent is exerted in certain cases
of polyuria. It is said to be specific also to nocturnal enuresis in children,
and yet our knowledge is not sufficient to define the exact cases, consequently
its use is more or less empirical. Benefit is claimed for its use in full doses in
all cases where there is much urine, without sugar.

This is the case in interstitial nephritis as well as in simple diabetes insipidus. It is not contraindicated in diabetes mellitus, but is only occasionally of service. Active astringent properties are claimed for it, and yet in
this exercise it is different from ordinary astringents.

RENAL CORRECTIVES 458

In many cases of urinary incontinence both in children and in the aged,
it will produce satisfactory cures. It apparently acts as a tonic and sedative
to the muscular structures of the urinary apparatus, as old people who suffer
from a general debilitated condition and are troubled with dribbling, have
the power to control the urine restored. It should be used freely in such
cases, and its influence when specifically defined will give it an important
place in the therapeutics of enuresis.

It has an influence not to be overlooked in passive hemorrhages from the
urinary apparatus—hzmaturia, controlling most satisfactorily many cases. It
is useful in passive uterine hemorrhage and in pulmonary and bronchial
hemorrhage. It is also useful in controlling night sweats and the diarrhea
of phthisis. The hemorrhage often present in chronic diarrhea and dysentery
is restrained by it, when it checks the action of the bowels also, improving
the tone and restoring normal function.

If satisfactory results are not obtained from small doses it may be
pushed until sixty drops are given to an adult.

In purpura hemorrhagica it has worked nicely and will often be found
useful. It has cured many cases of leucorrhea and of gonorrhea and other
passive discharges of a catarrhal character.

JAMBUL. SYZYGIUM JAMBOLANUM.
Synonyms—Eugenia Jambolana, Java Plum, Jamboo.
PREPARATIONS—Jambul seeds in powdered form. Dose, three to ten grains,

two or three times a day.

Fluid extract jambul seed, miscible with water. Dose, five to ten minims.

Physiological Action—The exact influence of this agent upon the system
is not well known. It is a stomachic astringent and carminative, a remedy of
value in diarrheas, It is non-toxic and non-irritant.

In the diarrhceas of children the juice of the fresh bark and leaves is
used by the native physicians, though all parts of the plant are astringent.
In the preparation of astringent injections and gargles the bark is quite
active. The root and seeds have the same influence.

The taste is at first bitter, afterwards distinctly pungent, and decidedly
astringent. Experiments have been conducted to determine the influence of
jambul upon diastatic fermentation. It is proven to have an inhibitory influence. A fixed amount of malt extract converted 22.4 grains of starch into
sugar. Jambul was added, and only 6.3 grains were converted under exactly
similar circumstances. This experiment was suggested by the characteristic
influence of the agent when taken by diabetic patients.

According to Morse, the agent augments the vaso-motor and reflex functions of the spinal cord by augmenting the blood pressure of the renal
arterioles. It diminishes the quantity and density of saccharine urine. It
increases peristaltic action of the intestines, and causes deeper and more frequent inspiratory movements. Wounds and ulcers, or syphilitic sores in
diabetics, cicatrize rapidly, and heal during the administration of this agent.

Therapy—lIts specific therapeutic application lies in the fact that the bark
and the seeds possess the property of arresting excessive formation and excretion of sugar in diabetes, the seeds being the most active.

Inasmuch as the pathology of the disease is obscure, and the physiological
action of the agent is comparatively unknown, it is impossible to make other
than an empirical use of this remedy in these cases. Given in from five to
ten grains of the powdered seeds, three times daily, it gradually overcomes
the thirst and weariness and diminishes the quantity of urine. After two or
three weeks the strength and spirits will return, and wandering and distressing pains and cramps abate, bleeding from the nose or gums, and night sweats

will cease, and the quantity of sugar will gradually decline. The dose may
be increased until forty grains are given in a day, and the probabilities are
that large doses would produce no serious results,

The agent has been widely used in the treatment of this disease, and is
as efficient as any other single remedy. The writer’s experience proves that
it acts best in those cases that have been long continued, with a comparatively
small amount of sugar present, where the slow progress of the disease has not
materially influenced the general health of the patient.

Among the qualified, observing physicians of India, it is believed that its
use will prevent the conversion of starches into sugar to any excessive extent,
and that starchy diet can be eaten with impunity during its administration.

POTASSIUM NITRATE.

Formula—KNO,,.

Administration—Five grains in solution every three hours is the usual
sre Ten grains three times daily is advised in chronic rheumatic conitions.

Physiological Action—If there be a free determination of blood to the
skin, the body surface being warm and moist, it acts immediately as a diaphoretic, otherwise it acts upon the kidneys as a diuretic. Its influence varies
also with the size of the dose, and with the quantity and temperature of the
water in which it is dissolved.

Physicians of fifty years ago depended upon this remedy as a sedative
to control fevers, but large doses are necessary to accomplish this result. It
tends to keep the bowels relaxed, does not greatly irritate the stomach, and
acts as an intestinal antiseptic.. The drug is an active eliminating agent. It
neutralizes excess of acidity in the blood and urine, and rapidly relieves the
blood of morbific material.

Therapy—It has long been used in rheumatism, both of an acute and
chronic character, in myalgia, lumbago, tic douloureux, sciatica, and other
forms of neuralgia. Two or three grains every two hours will accomplish
satisfactory results in acute cases.

Although antispasmodic properties are attributed to it, its influence in
the above described conditions is probably due to its neutralizing and eliminative action.

It is sometimes given in tonsillitis, which, if given in large doses, it will
abort.

If this salt be burned and the vapor inhaled, it will relieve the paroxysms
of uncomplicated spasmodic asthma. Bibulous papgr—blotting paper—should
be saturated with a solution of the salt in the proportion of one dram to an
ounce of hot water, and then be carefully dried, when it is ready for use. Of
this from ten to twenty square inches should be burned and the fumes inhaled.
It should burn with white fumes without smoke or explosive action, and not
too fast. When burned in a pitcher or in a narrow mouthed jar the fumes are
more conveniently inhaled.

Special Genitourinary Remedies.

STAPHYSAGRIA, SALIX ALBA. CUBEBA.
CORALLORHIZA, SAW PALMETTO. COPAIBA,
SALIX NIGRA. DAMIANA. SANDALWOOD.
POLYTRICHUM.
STAPHYSAGRIA. DELPHINUM STAPHYSAGRIA.
Synonym—Stavesacre.

ConstITUENTS—Delphinum, delphinoidine, delphesine, staphysagrine, fixed
oil, volatile oil, malic acid, mucilage.

PREPARATIONS—Tinctura staphysagrie, tincture of staphysagria. Dose,
from five to fifteen minims. Specific staphysagria. Dose, from one-sixth to
three minims,

Physiological Action—This has not been definitely determined. Taken
internally it acts as an irritant, causing vomiting and purging. Absorbed
into the circulation it causes convulsions and loss of sensation and motion; the
action of the heart and respiration is lessened and death is caused by paralysis
of the spinal cord and asphyxia. It first contracts and then dilates the pupil.
The agent is a permanent stimulant, resembling nux vomica somewhat and
acting in harmony with avena sativa, cactus and xanthoxylum. It will act
in harmony with hydrastis, which agent will intensify its influence. It relieves
mental depression, and should be given in hysteria and hypochondriasis,
where there is melancholia, despondency, and a general depression, Scudder
says, especially if accompanied with violent outbursts of passion.

Specific Symptomatology—tThis agent exercises a stimulant and tonic influence upon the central nervous system, and is especially valuable in sexual
disorders accompanied with melancholia, hypochondria, and hysteria, especially if there be outbursts of passion and a tendency to moroseness.

Therapy—Specifically considered this agent is a remedy for prostatic
disease. It is not curative in the entire range of disease of the prostate, but
is of much importance in assisting other indicated remedies. Prostatorrhea
is within the direct sphere of its influence. It should be used and persisted
in in this condition. While not alone curative in spermatorrhea, the complete
cure depends upon the action of this remedy in many cases, combined with
others. In gleet, the agent must not be omitted.

It relieves irritation of the prostate gland, testicles, and vesicule seminales, overcomes impotency, and increases sexual power. It arrests the excessive prostatic discharge and muco-purulent discharges from the urethra
and is valuable in old standing cases of gleet, often curing otherwise intractable cases, and in dysuria, especially if accompanied with feebleness in expelling urine, with the above specific indications. It may be given alternately with kava-kava.

It soothes the nervous excitement consequent upon these genito-urinary
or uterine disorders and is prompt and permanent when prescribed directly.

I have used it to good advantage with avena and saw palmetto in
impotence, especially that occurring in men who have been excessive and
dissipated in their habits, appearing usually about the age of forty-five.

Blake has used this remedy in prolapsus of the bladder walls, where a
radical operation was impossible and where the long train of symptoms were
exceedingly distressing. The remedy was given internally and used externally in the form of a saturated glycerole on tampons.

The agent has been advised in facial and cervical neuralgia, and has been
given in scrofulous disease of the eyes, in amaurosis, ophthalmia, and in
those conditions of the eyes, accompanying neurasthenia, where black spots
or floating particles appear before the eyes.

The agent must be persistently used, to be appreciated.

Five drops of specific staphysagria in two ounces of water, a teaspoonful
every two hours it is said, corrects many cases of night sweats in phthisis.
If the symptoms should increase after its use, the dose should be decreased.

King recommends staphysagria to be used externally for the destruction
of lice. Equal parts of the fluid extract and cologne water have been used
successfully in cases of pediculus pubis and pediculus capitas.

CORALLORHIZA. CORALLORHIZA ODONTORHIZA.

Synonyms—Crawley; Coral Root.

This agent stood very high in the estimation of the fathers of the botanieal school as a powerful diuretic and safe eliminative agent. It was considered the most active of all sweat producing remedies and so kindly was its
action and so devoid of prostrating influences that it has later been considered superior to jaborandi. It was used in the early stages of prostrating
fevers, and inflammatory troubles whatever the character. It was used in
night sweats and hectic fever without debility. It acts well in the early
stage of acute pneumonia and pleurisy, and given at the onset of a cold it is
most prompt in its action in eliminating all the symptoms.

In the first stage of consumption where there is hacking cough, loss of
weight, deficient appetite, while it acts slowly it overcomes the marked prostration and improves all the functional operations of the glandular organs.

Dr. Baker depended upon this remedy for the treatment of meningeal
inflammation, nervousness, restlessness, and general feverish symptoms, as
the agent is an active sedative as well as a powerful diaphoretic. It relieves
bronchial irritation with wheezing and tightness in the chest.

Now at the present time when the importance of elimination is well
understood and when the effects of elimination are so plainly apparent when
properly conducted, this remedy should be freely used in order to determine
by scientific means the amount of elimination secured and the actual substances removed, and the influence of such removal. The depressing effect
of jaborandi or pilocarpine prevents to an extent such observations which can
be safely made with this agent.

SALIX NIGRA. SALIX NIGRA AMENTS.

Synonym—Black Willow.

ConstITUENTS—Salicin, a glucoside, tannin, wax, gum..

Preparations—Specific Salix Nigra Aments. Dose, from ten to sixty

The tincture of the aments, or catkins, of the black willow, have increased medicinal properties over any other part of the tree. Specific Salix
Nigra Aments is a unique preparation and contains the full properties of the
drug. _

The agent was brought to the attention of the profession through its influence in controlling sexual hyperzsthesia and undue sexual excitement. It
is a remedy for satyriasis, erotomania and nymphomania, more particularly
from local irritation.

It relieves spermatorrhea when dependent upon these or similar causes,
and quiets the general nervous system. It is a remedy for ovarian congestion,
ovarian neuralgia and hyperesthesia, also for ovarian irritation in hysteria.
It will exercise a direct and satisfactory influence in many cases of hysteria,
overcoming the extreme excitability and nervousness, headache and the globus
hystericus, and will permit quiet, restful sleep. It will serve an excellent purpose in these cases in combination with general nerve tonics and restoratives,
greatly enhancing their influence.

SALIX., SALIX ALBA.

Synonym—White Willow.

ConstITUENTS—Salicin, wax, fat, gum.

Specific Symptomatology—Sexual irritability with lascivious dreams,
sexual erethrism, libidinous thoughts, extreme sexual excitability with uncontrollable desire; erotomania, nymphomania, and satyriasis, prostatitis, with
cystic irritation; acute prostatic enlargement, with cystitis, ovaritis, orchitis
and other sexual disorders resulting from excess and abuse.

Therapy—tThis to an extent is antimalarial and like the other agents of
this class it improves the tone of the gastro-intestinal tract and the glandular
organs. It corrects impaired conditions of all mucous membranes and is thus
of value in excessive catarrhal discharges from these membranes, being
freely given in bronchorrhea, gastric catarrh, catarrhal diarrhea and in
leucorrheea, in all cases acting more promptly if malarial conditions have
caused the existing debility. It has antiseptic properties, of course, if antimalarial, and is a good remedy in protracted fevers.

It has a mild influence in controlling passive hemorrhages, but cannot be
depended upon if they are severe.

Its antiseptic properties are apparent in its ability to correct the fetor of
wounds and offensive discharges when locally applied.

Felter and Lloyd, in the American Dispensatory, make the following
statement concerning the action of this remedy, which is important. Its field
of action in those functional wrongs of the reproductive organs is due most
largely to undue irritability of the parts and thought to be less due to mental
or emotional causes. However, sexual passion from any functional cause is
moderated by it, and it is especially adapted to the disorders of the sexually
intemperate male or female and of the youth, subject day or night to libidinous
suggestions and lascivious dreams terminating in pollutions, while for those
extreme forms of sexual perversion, satyriasis, erotomania and nymphomania,
it is more nearly specific than any other agent. Not only does salix nigra act
as a check to sexual passion and misuse, but it proves a useful tonic and
sedative to many conditions following in the wake of sexual intemperance,
among which may be mentioned spermatorrheea, in its varied forms, prostatitis, cystitis and ovaritis.

SAW PALMETTO. SERENOA SERRULATA.

Synonym—Sabal serrulata.

Specific Medicine Saw Palmetto. Dose, ten drops to one dram.

Physiological Action—The attention of the profession was called to this
palm by Goss and others, from its superior fat producing properties in animals. It was observed as soon as the berries matured that the animals which
fed upon them grew very sleek and fat. Read noticed the marked healthfulness of these animals, and concluded to try the berries as a medicine. As a

result he found them to improve the digestion, increase the flesh, strength
and weight, and steadily relieve irritation of mucous structures, especially
those of the nose and air passages. Subsequent observation has proven the
remedy to be a tonic of much power in stimulating the nutrition of the nerve
centers, upon and through which it operates.

It relieves irritability of the entire nervous system and soothes local irritation. It stimulates digestion, greatly improves the appetite, and encourages assimilation.

As stated, it influences the mucous structures of the nose, throat and
bronchi in a remarkable manner, overcoming catarrh and restoring normal
function.

Specific Symptomatology—The direct influence of this agent is exerted
upon the entire reproductive apparatus, especially upon the prostate gland
of the male. It is demanded in enlarged prostate, with throbbing, aching, dull
pain, discharge of prostatic fluid, at times discharge of mucus, also of a yellowish, watery fluid, with weakened sexual power, orchialgia, epididymitis
and orchitis, when associated with enlarged prostate. In women, ovarian
enlargement, with tenderness and dull aching pains, weakened sexual activity,
and small, undeveloped mammary glands, are much benefited by its continued use.

Therapy—It is a sedative to all irritable conditions of these organs, and
is a profound nutritive tonic, operating much like phosphorus. It increases
the size and secreting power of the mammary glands where they are abnormally small and inactive. It improves the tone, and overcomes irritability of
the ovaries, relieving dysmenorrhea when due to atonicity. It may be given
with confidence in wasting of the testes in the early stages, and the author
has retarded the development of varicocele and has developed the growth and
nutrition of the testes materially by its use.

To this agent is ascribed considerable power in reducing the size of
hypertrophied prostate in old men, and in quickly relieving cystic and other
disorders incident to this condition. In the writer’s hands it has produced
no marvelous cures of this disorder, but it has been of assistance to other
measures and could not be well dispensed with. It relieves irritation of the
bladder to a satisfactory extent, correcting the irritable character of the
urine, increases the muscular power of the patient to expel the urine and
produces a sense of relief, that is in every way gratifying and satisfactory.

In the treatment of impotence in young men who have been excessive in
their habits, or have masturbated, it can be relied upon with positiveness. It
will overcome the excitability from exhaustion and increase sexual power in
those newly married who, having been anxious concerning their sexual
strength or ability, have become suddenly almost entirely impotent after marriage. If the patient is instructed to abstain, for from four to six weeks, and
to have confidence in his ultimate recovery, this agent in doses of from twenty
to thirty drops three or four times daily, combined with a direct nerve tonic,
such as avena sativa in doses of fifteen drops, or the one one-hundredth of a
grain of phosphorus, will establish a cure. It will relieve any undue irritation, due to excess and exhaustion, that may be present in any part of the
genito-urinary apparatus.

This agent is a remedy for sexual neurasthenia or sexual perversion with
nerve exhaustion, a condition often overlooked in diagnosis, but quite common, one which follows onanism more often than any other habit. Its use
should be persisted in for wecks, in the treatment of this form of nerve
exhaustion, and if combined with avena sativa, the phosphates, strychnia, or
the tonic gold salts, and abstinence enforced, a cure will result more readily
than with all the rest without it.

An exceedingly important use for this remedy that I have not been able
to find in the books, is its use for sterility. In simple cases where there is no
organic lesion on the part of the patient, this agent has an excellent reputation for restoring the ovarian action properly and assisting in putting the
patient into an excellent condition. One conscientious reliable lady physician
assures me that in five definite cases, pregnancy has followed the use of this
remedy where sterility was pronounced: previously, and thought to be incurable.

The late Dr. E. M. Hale in his little work on this remedy said:

“‘T consider saw palmetto one of the most effectual uterine remedies.’’

“‘T believe it will be found, if administered early, to be the chief remedy
in metritis, pelvic cellulitis and peritonitis, salpingitis, ovaritis, puerperal
fever, appendicitis (giving first teaspoonful doses of pure olive oil every half
hour until the pain is relieved, which seldom requires more than five or six
doses.) It is also valuable in perityphlitis and proctitis, especially if the
prostate gland is involved.’’

In its influence upon the nasal and bronchial mucous membranes this
agent has been given with excellent advantage in the treatment of acute
catarrh, chronic bronchial coughs of all characters, including whoopingcough, laryngitis and the cough of phthisis. It is credited also with cures in
the treatment of aphonia.,

DAMIANA. TURNERA APHRODISIACA.

Synonym—Turnera Microphylla.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Damiana Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Damiana.
Dose, from one-half to one dram.

Specific Damiana. Dose, from two to ten minims.

ConstITUENTS—Essential oil, chlorophyl, two resins, albuminoids, tannin.

Therapy—A mild nerve tonic claimed to be valuable in the treatment of
sexual impotence. Some of our physicians praise it highly for its influence in
sexual neurasthenia, and it is said to correct frigidity in the female.

It had long enjoyed a local reputation as a stimulant tonic of the sexual
apparatus among the natives of Mexico, before it attracted the attention of
the profession. Besides its peculiar action on the sexual appetite and function, it is a general tonic, somewhat cathartic, and is slightly cholagogue.

The midwives and women of loose morals of Western Mexico also attribute emmenagogue properties to it.

Dr. Reid uses Damiana in all conditions where a general tonic is needed,
especially if there be enfeeblement of the central nervous system. He
esteems it most highly, prescribing it constantly for this purpose.

It is valuable in renal and cystic catarrh and in general irritation of the
urinary passages, through its influence in soothing irritation of mucous
membranes.

This latter property renders it valuable in the treatment of respiratory
disorders, especially those accompanied with profuse secretion.

In the line of the action of this remedy in its influence upon the reproductive organs, Dr. Reid mentions dysmenorrhea, headache, at the menstrual
epoch, bad complexion, rough or discolored patches on the skin with acne,
especially of a severe type, depending upon uterine irritation. Eruption resembling eczema, from insufficient menstruation.

Dr. Watkins gives as its further indications, delayed or suppressed menstruation in young girls, irregularity at the beginning of menstruation,
amenorrhea in very young girls. It will certainly allay sensitiveness of the
sympathetic nervous system to irritations caused by disorders of the womb

and ovaries. The remedy must be given in full doses, to accomplish these
results. From five to ten grains of the extract is necessary three or four
times a day, and persisted in. The writer has been using it as suggested, and
has been very well satisfied with it.

In one most severe case of acne, with discoloration of the skin, due to
uterine irritation, the results were satisfactory, both to the patient and physician. I am satisfied that it relieves hyperesthesia of the sympathetic nervous
system and prevents many of the results of reflex irritation from uterine or
ovarian disorder.

POLYTRICHUM. POLYTRICHUM JUNIPERUM.

Synonym—Hair-cap moss.

ConstTITUENTS—Not analyzed.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Polytrichum. Dose, from five to sixty minims.

Specific Symptomatology—The agent is used in anasarca, ascites, urinary
obstruction, suppression of urine in children, febrile and inflammatory
diseases, uric and phosphatic acid gravel, acute gonorrhea with severe burning pain on passing urine, irritation of the bladder, difficult micturition of
pregnancy, and often occurring during parturition.

Therapy—The agent is a hydragogue diuretic and causes a very large
evacuation of urine when administered in dropsy, while it promotes the absorption of the fluid at the same time. It tends to relieve the pain of urinary
calculi and to prevent their formation.

Though it is not always effective, probably on account of using a spurious
article, the genuine has been known to remove forty pounds of urine from a
dropsical patient in twenty-four hours.

CUBEBA. PIPER CUBEBA.

Synonym—Cubebs.

ConstITUENTS—Volatile oil, fixed oil, wax, resin, cubebin, gum, malates,
cubebic acid.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Cubebe Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Cubeb. Dose,
from five to thirty minims. Oleum Cubebe, Oil of Cubeb. Dose, ten minims.
Oleoresina Cubebe, Oleoresin of Cubeb. Dose, from five to thirty minims.
Specific Cubeb. Dose, from five to twenty minims.

Physiological Action—Stimulant, carminative, expectorant, stomachic. It
stimulates the intestinal tract like black pepper, and, in excessive doses,
causes nausea, vomiting, burning pain, griping and purging. The active principle being absorbed causes general stimulation and a feverish condition, and
sometimes redness of the skin.

Therapy—Cubebs is in common use in the treatment of gonorrhea. Its
best results are obtained when the active stage has passed, being especially
useful in gleet, and also useful in the discharge present after acute prostatitis,
especially if purulent in character, where the parts are greatly debilitated and
there is catarrh of the bladder with nocturnal incontinence of urine, or in
spermatorrhea with enfeeblement, it is a useful remedy.

A snuff of powdered cubebs is of much benefit in acute coryza if there is
free secretion. It is beneficial also in some chronic cases.

A cigarette is prepared of cubebs, which is smoked to relieve hoarseness.
It serves a good purpose in this form in sub-acute or chronic bronchitis or in
any case of general relaxation with debility of the mucous structures of these
parts.

COPAIBA. COPAIBA LANGSDORFFII.

Part Employed—The oleoresin.

Oleoresin of Copaiba is obtained by boring holes into the trunk of the
tree near its base, from which the oleoresin is collected. It is a translucent,
viscid liquid, of a pale or brownish-yellow color, having a characteristic odor
and a bitter, acrid, nauseous taste. Solvents, alcohol, ether, chloroform.
Dose, from five to sixty grains.

Oleum Copaiba—Oil of Copaiba. The volatile oil, which is obtained by
distillation, is a limpid, pale-yellow liquid, with the odor of copaiba, and a
pungent, aromatic, bitter taste. Dose, from ten to fifteen drops.

ConstITUENTS—Volatile oil, copavic acid, bitter principle, resin.

PREPARATIONS—Massa Copaibe, Mass of Copaiba. Dose, from ten to sixty

Mistura Copaibe Composita, Compound Copaiba Mixture. Dose, from a
half to one dram.

Therapy—This agent is used in the treatment of gonorrhea. It is best
used after active inflammation has subsided where the mucous structures of
the urinary tract are debilitated. It is useful in gleet or chronic urethritis
with much relaxation and debility, and if anema be present, it should be
given in conjunction with iron. It is given in general irritation of the urinary
passages from debility, and in pyelitis and cystitis, increasing the urinary
discharge and relieving painful urination. In inflammation of the respiratory
tract with excessive expectoration of thick and tenacious mucus, it may be
employed to good advantage if the balsam of copaiba be given in ten drop
doses three times a day. It is of assistance in curing eczema, urticaria, and
other itching skin disorders. For persistent backache, Dr. Whitford combined two drams of the above with two ounces of the spirit of nitric ether,
and tincture of black cherry to make three ounces. Of this he gave a dram
once or twice daily.

SANDALWOOD. SANTALUM ALBUM.

Synonyms—Yellow Saunders, White Saunders.
Part Employed—The wood.

PrepPaRATIONS—Fluid Extract of Sandalwood, not miscible with water.
Dose, one-half to two fluid drams. Sandal Oil, dose, ten minims.

Administration—The oil of sandalwood is administered in doses of from
ten to fifteen or even twenty minims three times daily. It is best given in a
capsule, and soft gelatine capsules are prepared filled with the oil. It is also
given in emulsion, but there are objections to this method of administration.

Therapy—tThe oil of santal is of service in the treatment of sub-acute and
chronic inflammations of mucous surfaces, especially those wherein there is
excessive secretion. In catarrhal bronchitis it is beneficial, quickly allaying
irritation and reducing the excessive discharge.

It is in more general use in the treatment of gonorrhea after the subsidence of the acute or active inflammatory phenomena. It will be found of
service in the treatment of protracted cases, and in gleet.

GROUP VIII.

Agents Used for Their Influence Upon the Skin.

JABORANDI. NITRATE OF SILVER. THAPSIA.
SERPENTARIA. PICRIC ACID. ZINC OXIDE.
CAMPHORIC ACID. CANTHARIDES. LANOLIN.
YOHIMBE.
PILOCARPUS. PILOCARPUS JABORANDI.
Synonym—Jaborandi.

ConstITUENTS—Pilocarpine, jaborine, volatile oil, tannic acid, volatile acid,
potassium chloride.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Pilocarpi Fluidum. Fluid Extract of Pilocarpus. Dose, from five to sixty minims.. Specific Medicine Jaborandi. Dose, from one-fourth of a minim to three
minims.,

Administration—In the administration of this agent the characteristic
results may be obtained almost equally well, either from an infusion of the
leaves, or from any of the preparations named. The hypodermic administration of the alkaloid pilocarpine, is preferable in many cases, especially
where the promptness of its action is desired. The liquid preparations are
often unacceptable to a disordered or sensitive stomach and then minute
doses of the alkaloid in pellets or granules will be found a most desirable
form for administration.

The action of the fluid extract or tincture of jaborandi and impure pilocarpine is sometimes disappointing, failing entirely to produce their characteristic influence and perhaps producing results contrary to those anticipated. This is due to the presence of the alkaloid, jaborine, which acts antagonistically to pilocarpine, having in its therapeutic influence many of the
characteristics of atropine, an antagonist of pilocarpine.

The nitrate and hydrochlorate of pilocarpine carefully prepared are
free from jaborine and are thus reliable in their action. Solutions of pilocarpine should be made fresh when needed, as the salts decompose in aqueous
solution. They are not permanent but will precipitate at once in alkaline
solutions.

Physiological Action—Near the point of the administration of a hypodermic injection of the alkaloid, a few drops of sweat appear within from
four to six minutes after the injection, to be immediately followed with
moisture on the forehead, neck and chest, and in quick succession the entire
body is bathed with a most profuse perspiration.

-It is a powerful anti-diphtheritic and sialogogue, acting profoundly as
a stimulant upon the secretions of the entire glandular system. No one
known remedy stimulates every secretion of the body simultaneously as profoundly as does this agent..

The depression of the agent should not be allowed to progress; after
the sweating has continued a few minutes profusely, a little whisky, brandy,
tincture of ginger, or tincture of capsicum should be given in hot water,
and occasionally repeated while the transpiration progresses. If the heart

## Page 456

GENERAL SKIN REMEDIES 463

shows the influence of the depression, a hypodermic of strychnine may be
given, or a few drops of the tincture of cactus, strophanthus, digitalis, or
nux vomica. If it is desirable to stop the sweating abruptly, atropine hypodermically may be resorted to.

The extreme effects of the agent need not be obtained in many cases,
but owing to the susceptibility of some cases a small dose will sometimes produce extreme results. It is safe to obtain these results in extreme sthenic
cases—in robust patients. The reaction will be prompt and satisfactory.

Most observers state that it is best to quench the thirst with weak coffee
or milk and not with cold water. It is undesirable that the patient swallow
the saliva when the agent is administered after the bite of venomous snakes
or in threatened hydrophobia or if given as an antidote to poisons.

When the agent fails to act upon the skin it often expends its force
upon the salivary glands, kidneys, stomach, intestines or lungs, producing
extreme secretion or excretion from these organs. In some cases this agent
produces nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, contracted pupil, extreme weakness,
dimness of vision, sighing respiration, palpitation and collapse; but these
symptoms of alarming nervous depression rarely occur and are easily combated with atropine.

Specific Symptomatology—The direct indications for this agent are
acute suppression of the secretions, especially o1 those of the skin in sthenic
conditions usually with distress, elevation of temperature, sharp, hard pulse,
dry skin, dry mucous membranes, constipation, and small quantity of urine
with dark color and high specific gravity.

Kinnett gives the specific indications for its use, as dry hot skin, dry
parched mouth, pulse full and very strong, patient restless and uneasy, suppression of the secretions, especially of the kidneys, which seem to be unable to act properly. His contra-indications are feebleness, weak pulse, weak
heart action, tendency to depression.

Contra-Indications—Jaborandi should be avoided in asthenic conditions,
or where there is feeble or dilated heart, and used with care in old people
and ‘young children. Except in its influence on laryngeal and bronchial disorders, and in the sthenic stage of diphtheria when it loosens the membranes.

Therapy—At the onset of acute febrile and inflammatory conditions, especially if there be rigors, hot, full head, and a bounding, hard pulse, a foot
bath of hot water and a full dose of jaborandi with proper supportive treatment subsequently will often end the attack abruptly. The stage following
the influence of the agent if the temperature has subsided, has all the conditions in which quinine works to its best possible advantage.

Several recent writers have written enthusiastically on the action of
jaborandi or pilocarpine in establishing a favorable crisis early in the severe
forms of acute disease. Pernicious malarial fever, typho-malarial fever, inflammatory rheumatism, and other of the severer forms of inflammatory disease they claim may be aborted by the use of full doses of this remedy.
Where jaborandi can be administered by the mouth, it is preferable, although some claim that pilocarpine hypodermically invariably produces better results.

A number advise the use of this remedy in comatose, delirious and colliquative forms of pernicious intermittent fever. These writers agree upon
the surprising influence of the remedy, where at the onset of this disease or
of other acute specific fever there is great excitable mania—extreme violent
delirium, which in its seriousness overtops all other conditions. The above
indications of Kinnett will usually be exaggerated at these times. If an
eighth of a grain of pilocarpine be administered hypodermically, the delirium disappears at once, quiet and restfulness obtain without the occur-

rence of the physiological action of the remedy upon the skin or salivary
glands. There is a disagreement of opinion as to its value in the treatment
of convulsions. Kinnett claims that where the intestinal tract is overloaded
with irritating material, it produces both emesis and active free bowel movement, at the same time stimulating the action of the kidneys and skin.

In a case of extreme malarial poisoning, in a strong man, the bowels
had not been moved for three days, nor the urine voided for eighteen hours.
The temperature was 107 degrees, and the pulse 140, full and bounding.
The skin was of a jaundiced appearance and the conjunctive was distinctly
yellow. One-half grain of pilocarpine hypodermically, caused salivation in
three minutes, perspiration stood on the neck and forehead in great drops,
the face and skin became extremely red at first and pale as the perspiration
advanced. He immediately passed a large quantity of dark-colored, highly
offensive urine. He vomited, and had a movement from the bowels, large
and copious. The doctor claimed that more was accomplished by this one
dose of medicine in one hour in the way of elimination, than he could have
accomplished otherwise, in forty-eight hours. Vomitirg from pilocarpine is
not at all severe. There is no violent straining. The act is more like one of
regurgitation.

This agent can be used to good advantage in alcoholism. Administered
hypodermically, it has a prompt sobering effect. It induces sleep, from
which the patient awakes rational and subdued. The transformation in the. physical appearance of the patient is marked. The tense red, bloated countenance, the bleared congested eyes, the general repulsive facial aspect pass
away, and the skin assumes a clean and soft appearance, the features are
calm, and the eyes clear. It has been used with good advantage in the
treatment of gall stones, one-eighth of a grain three or four times a day has
relieved severe cases.

In inflammations of the lungs or pleura, with exudation, it promotes
resolution and quickly removes the exudate. In bronchitis with dry, irritable, or hoarse cough, with imperfect secretion, it acts admirably as an expectorant. It lessens the cough as well as influencing the temperature. In
laryngitis, tonsillitis or diphtheritis it is used by many physicians as the
most important factor in the treatment. It is especially indicated in stridulous laryngitis..

In the treatment of epidemic influenza it has been given in small doses
with persistency. It is said to render important service in the cure by restoring secretion.

In laryngeal diphtheria and in membranous croup, given in doses of
from two to five drops every two hours, in conjunction with antiseptic treatment, it increases the mucus and salivary secretions and loosens the membrane and causes its exfoliation promptly and satisfactorily. It can be relied upon if the forces of the system can be sustained and if it does not produce too great prostration. Feeble children will not do as well under this
treatment as robust and vigorous ones.

In bronchial asthma or in dyspnea, from acute pulmonary engorgement,
it gives prompt relief.

The agent in doses of from one-half to one drop often repeated during
the afternoon or evening has controlled most satisfactorily the night sweats
of slow convalescence and of pulmonary phthisis.

Dr. Standlee gave jaborandi for stiffness of the joints, five drops with
one drop of rhus in a teaspoonful of simple elixir, three times a day.

Dr. Lass gave jaborandi for pruritus as a functional affection of the
skin with itching, burning, and prickly sensations, especially winter itch, socalled, or frost itch with curative results.

GENERAL SKIN REMEDIES 465

Jaborandi in diphtheria and in membranous croup must be used constantly to be appreciated, but it certainly is a very efficient agent. It removes the membrane sometimes in a few hours, and given with echinacea or
inhalations of eucalyptus and turpentine in the early stages, no membrane
will be formed.

The agent is a heart sedative of acknowledged ability and is reliable.
It controls the heart’s action, the pulse, and the temperature similarly to
aconite or gelsemium, with either of which it may be well combined and its
influences heightened by the combination. In febrile conditions where nervous complications are anticipated, and where spasm has occurred, it has a
sedative and direct anti-spasmodic influence, operating synergistically with
gelsemium or the bromides.

Webster lays great stress upon the specific sedative properties of this
remedy. He also believes that in certain cases it has a place distinct from
that of aconite or veratrum. He believes that it can be adjusted even to
asthenic cases. It imparts a cooling sensation to the skin, relieves headache
arising from the fever, calms nervous irritation, and soothes local inflammatory action. It dissipates the surface heat, and acts immediately upon the
secretion of saliva and overcomes sordes very quickly, cleaning the mouth
completely, restoring all secretions.

In inflammatory diseases of the chest he believes that it does all that
asclepias does, and more. He combines it with echinacea in erysipelas. He
believes that it relieves irritability of the heart and blood vessels, and induces normal equilibrium. The dosage for these purposes is invariably
small—not to exceed one or two minims, and frequently repeated.

The agent has been used in hydrocephalus, and in other effusions into
the membranes of the brain or spinal cord, but there are apt to be contraindications and it must therefore be used discreetly, and combined with
other agents as indicated, and the strength of the patient supported.

It is useful in all local or general dropsies with discriminating judgment
in its administration.:

In acute inflammatory rheumatism or in rheumatic fever it should not
be neglected as few agents will take its place. A single sufficient dose of
pilocarpine will often relieve the pain, at the onset, promptly. It will be
indicated during the course of chronic rheumatism as its influence in eliminating urea, uric acid and other morbific products is of excellent service
here. It may be given in full doses once or twice each week or oftener, in
much the same manner as a Turkish bath would be administered. Its influence is much wider than any baths.

In acute mastitis with suppression of milk after confinement it quickly
relieves congestion and restores the lacteal secretion. It is a prompt and
efficient galactagogue at any time. Sufficient doses to induce active transpiration need not be given, but five to ten drops of the tincture four times
daily for a few days will accomplish the result. If the milk is entirely suppressed it may sometimes be restored if this remedy is administered immediately. In such a case a full dose should first be given, followed subsequently by smaller doses at longer intervals.

It has been used to advantage also in acute orchitis, and it will serve a
good purpose in some cases of acute ovaritis or metritis.

A writer in the Medical and Surgical Reporter says that having observed that parturition progresses most favorably when there is diaphoresis,
he now produces that condition early by the use of jaborandi; he gives onethird of a teaspoonful of the green fluid extract in half a wineglass of water
every half hour until perspiration occurs. The effect is a soothing one,
often relieving the severity of the pains. The os rapidly dilates, the soft

parts assume a more favorable condition, and the labor is soon terminated
favorably. He has seen only good results from its use. Many writers agree
on the action of the remedy in rigid os uteri, where the pains are hard, the
muscular system tense, and the skin dry.

If prostration occurs from the profusion of the perspiration the skin is
thoroughly dried, the patient is given a stimulating drink and warmly covered, and there are no further unpleasant results. It does not necessarily
increase the danger of post-partum hemorrhage unless the effect of the agent
is severe, in which case a full dose of ergot at the completion of the second
stage of labor or a hypodermic of strychnia will insure prompt uterine
contraction.

These facts are especially true if during confinement the skin is hot and
the os unyielding, rigid and painful, the pains hard and unsatisfactory, the
pulse sharp and hard, and perhaps the temperature rising. A full dose of
jaborandi will often change the entire condition, at once producing relaxation of the os, free secretion, more expulsive and less irritating pains and a
general soothed and quiet condition.

Many writers confirm the value of this agent in puerperal eclampsia.
A French authority treated ten consecutive cases with satisfactory results,
with the hydrochlorate of pilocarpine. He concludes that feebleness of the
pulse, as long as the convulsions reappear, is not a contra-indication to a
repetition of the dose.

When permissible it should be given in a single, full, prompt dose. Its
best influences are directed toward elimination of the urea, thus relieving
the uremia and reducing dropsical effusions. Its anti-spasmodic influence,
while not always, perhaps, to be depended upon alone, is exercised harmoniously with the indicated anti-spasmodic, whether it be veratrum, chloral, the bromides, morphia, passiflora or gelsemium.

In exanthematous fevers of all kinds jaborandi in small doses is the
remedy par excellence. In robust cases, with scarlet fever, the determination to the skin and the elimination from the skin is so prompt and efficient
that post-scarlatinal nephritis need not be anticipated.

Waugh is authority for the statement that the agent is efficacious in
acute sthenic erysipelas. It may be given in twenty drop doses, every four
hours, and any prostrating influences antagonized. Local applications should
not be neglected, but should be selected with care, and prompt tonics and
restoratives should be administered in conjunction. In asthenic cases the
agent should not be unqualifiedly discarded, but it may be adapted in small
doses to the case in hand.

Pilocarpine has a selective action for the skin, and is prescribed by specialists in a number of skin diseases, notably in pruritus, eczema, prurigo,
and in hyperidrosis pedum. It is given in small doses long continued.

Its continued internal use for other conditions has been known to result in an increased growth of the hair with restoration of the original color
of gray hair.

Pilocarpine in the proportion of two grains to the ounce of lanoline is
a common application to the scalp to restore the hair and prevent baldness.
It may be combined with cantharides.

Ophthalmologists claim excellent results from its use in a number of
diseases of the eye. In iritis it overcomes inflammations and removes adhesions. It causes rapid absorption of all exudates. It is of benefit in detachment of the retina and in optic neuritis. In all inflammatory conditions
it is of service. It is beneficial after extraction of the lens, and is said to
promote the absorption of opacities in the vitreous humor which have re-

GENERAL SKIN REMEDIES 467

sulted from recent infiltration. It acts upon the pupil much after the manner of eserine.

Dr. Kent O. Foltz employed the drug regularly in iridocyclitis, in plastic
and traumatic iritis, in rheumatis iritis, in hylatis, in simple glaucoma and in
some cases of optic neuritis; also in traumatism of the eye, where there is
effusion of the blood into the aqueous or vitrious humors, in retinal hemorrhage, in chorio-retinitis, and in detachment of the retina. It has been
beneficial in beginning atrophy of the optic nerve. In interstital keratitis,
and in chronic conjunctivitis, also in croupus and diphtheritic conjunctivitis.

In the treatment of ear disease, it has a more limited use. In dry ¢atarrh of the middle ear, and in eczema of the external auditory canal it has
some beneficial influence. In effusion into the labyrinth it facilitates absorption. In atrophic rhinitis, and pharyngitis, it increases the activity of the
glands, and produces general salutary results.

A few doses of from twenty to thirty drops of jaborandi are given internally in cases of severe rhus poisoning, combined with proper external
applications.

In the treatment of the bite of venomous snakes and in anticipated hydrophobia, and in poisoning from canned fish and other meats—in ptomaine
poisoning, the salts are administered in maximum doses.

The patient will show but little of the prostrating influences of the
drug. It is eliminative in its influence, only the poison must be antidoted by
the proper remedy, and in organic poisons the permanganate of potassium is
an efficient remedy.

SERPENTARIA. ARISTOLOCHIA SERPENTARIA.

Synonym—Virginia Snakeroot.

ConsTITUENTS—Volatile oil, aristolochine (bitter principle), resin, gum,
starch, albumen.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Serpentarie Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Serpentaria. Dose, from ten to thirty minims.:

Specific Medicine Serpentaria. Dose, from one to sixty minims.

Therapy—tThe action of snakeroot in restoring secretion after a severe
cold, in sudden, acute inflammation, and in the early stages of acute fevers,
is most strongly marked. It is valuable, also, in the advanced stages of
fevers where there is persistent suppression of secretion, and where the prostration contra-indicates active diaphoretics, ete. It exercises a tonic effect
on the nervous system, while it promotes secretion. It is of much value during the progress of typhoid fever.

In scarlet fever and measles and in small-pox it is a useful remedy. It
hastens a tardy eruption, and restores the eruption promptly if it has receded. It must be given in full doses up to a dram of the tincture. It acts
as a mild restorative tonic at the same time.

It was popular among the older physicians as an active eliminative
agent. It was used in chronic ague as an antiperiodic and tonic. It was
claimed to supersede quinine in some cases; cynanche maligna has been cured
by it; serofula and evidences of blood dyscrasia are benefited by it. It is of
use in chronic rheumatism, and combined with more active agents, in acute
cases. It stimulates digestion in,enfeebled cases, and encourages a better
action from all the glandular organs.

468 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS: ACIDUM CAMPHORICUM

Synonym—Camphoric Acid.

Administration—Dose, from one to twenty grains. Large doses are
necessarily given in capsules unless dissolved in a large quantity of water.

Therapy—The agent acts specifically upon the skin and mucous membranes, controlling excessive secretion. Twenty grains of the acid taken an
hour before going to bed will control some of the worst cases of night sweats.
It is especially applicable in phthisis, but is also valuable in the profuse sweating that occurs during the recovery from prostrating fevers.

In excessive mucous discharges from whatever cause, it is a valuable
remedy. A one per cent solution may be used in nasal catarrh as a douche,
in laryngitis and in bronchitis and as an application in mild forms of sore
throat.

ARGENTI NITRAS.

Formula—AgNo,.

Synonyms—Silver nitrate, nitrate of silver, lunar caustic.

Therapy—Under the present enlightened condition of therapeutics, the
use of this and similar agents internally, is unjustifiable, and is practiced
only in ignorance of better remedies. It has been employed in small doses
in ulceration of the stomach, and in catarrhal conditions of that organ and
the intestinal canal. It is said to give relief in chronic gastric pain and to
be of benefit in some forms of dyspepsia.

As a local application, for external use, the agent is manageable and of
much service. It is applicable to chronic ulceration of whatever character,
especially of mucous surfaces. Carefully applied to ulceration of the os or
cervix uteri, after these parts have been well cleansed, much benefit results.

In unhealthy granulation of wounds, known as proud flesh, this caustic
is curative. In the proportion of from one to five grains in an ounce of
water, it is useful in ophthalmia neonatorum and in gonorrheal opthalmia.
It is also used in granulation of the eyelids and in some cases of purulent
conjunctivitis.

It has been applied to erysipelatous surfaces, but the tincture of iron is
a superior agent.

It is serviceable in dilute solution in the treatment of leucorrhea of a
specific or non-specific character, and in gonorrhea, whether in the male or
female.

It is also applicable to abnormal growths, some simple forms being
aborted by it. It has been applied to felons in their early stages and to boils,
before suppuration, with good results.

ACIDUM PICRICUM.

Synonyms—Picric acid, carbazotic acid, trinitraphenol.

Occurrence—This acid is obtained from the action of creosote upon
nitric acid, or by dissolving pure crystallized carbolie acid in sulphuric acid
and treating this product with nitric acid or with sodium nitrate.

Description—It is crystalline in character, light yellow in color, bitter,
freely soluble in water, sublimes without decomposition, and explodes upon
heating. Its salts of potassium and sodium are too unstable for use in medicine, being violent explosives, the ammonium salt alone being in common
use.


<!-- chunk -->

GENERAL SKIN REMEDIES 469

Physiological Action—It acts as an irritating depressant. In poisonous
doses, there is a reduction of temperature and blood pressure, shallow breathing, rapid, feeble heart action, great weakness, profuse diarrhea with pain
in the stomach and bowels, and collapse. In some cases convulsions occur
followed by death.

It colors the serum of the blood, materially increases the white corpuscles
and alters the character of the red blood cells. The action of the agent as
a medicine is considered in the action of the picrate of ammonium.

Therapy—Picric acid is used in the treatment of superficial burns by a
number of eminent authorities, but in the treatment of extensive and deep
burns, there is danger of poisoning. Sterilized gauze is soaked in a five per
cent solution of picric acid and laid over the entire burned surface, a light
dressing is laid over this and the whole is retained by a light bandage.
After three days it may be thoroughly moistened with a solution of the acid
as it will become very dry, and may be removed. A second dressing may be
applied as the first. It controls pain and rapidly promotes healing. When
granulation is progressing, and pus no longer forms, it may be replaced by
a simpler dressing.

In some cases the solution is simply brushed over the surface thoroughly,
and gauze placed over it for a few days.

Stains from the use of picric acid may be removed by alcohol, a solution
of boric acid, or a strong soap.

CANTHARIDES. CANTHARIS VESICATORIA.

Synonyms—Spanish Flies, Blister Beetle.

ConstITuENTs—Cantharidin, extractives, salts and fat.

Cantharidin is a crystalline body obtained by exhausting the powder
with chloroform. The crystals are colorless prisms, soluble in alcohol, chloroform, ether and in volatile oils, and to a limited extent in water. It is the
irritating, blistering constituent of the powder.

PREPARATIONS—Tinctura Cantharidis, Tincture of Cantharides. Dose,
from one to ten minims.

Specific Cantharis. Dose, from one to five minims in water.

With many physicians the agent is always prescribed in small doses frequently repeated—from five to fifteen drops in four ounces of water, a teaspoonful every one, two or three hours.

Ceratum Cantharidis—Cantharides cerate, made of cantharides, yellow
wax, lard and turpentine.

Physiological Action—Internally the agent will produce gastro-intestinal
irritation, pain, nausea, vomiting, bloody stools, suppression of urine, with
irritation in passing, strangury, swelling of the external genitals, general depression, convulsions and death. It increases sexual desire, and is an active
emmenagogue and abortifacient.

Applied externally the agent produces at first, local stimulation, a reddening of the skin and subsequent vesication, the vesicles filling with serum,
producing prompt and marked derivation and general depression.

Therapy—In small doses this agent is in use in the treatment of cystitis
and bladder irritations, accompanied with tenesmus and constant desire. It
is serviceable in enuresis when there is relaxation of the bladder walls, and
lack of control of the sphincter, especially in that common to relaxed plethoric women, when upon their feet, and when coughing.

It is of some benefit in the treatment of dropsies, especially of those following scarlet fever, and diabetes in its later stages.

It is occasionally beneficial in eczema and acne, when accompanied with
uterine or vesical irritation, or with amenorrhea. In small doses it is prescribed in sub-acute or chronic gonorrhea or gleet.

As a vesicant, or blistering agent, cantharides has long been used in the
treatment of local inflammations of all characters, usually in sthenic stages,
as its derivative influence _Produces debility. Diseases of the brain and
spinal cord, and their meninges, have been treated with extreme derivation
from its action and often with good results. As a local stimulant in hypostatic congestions the agent has been much used, being applied in such cases
short of vesication.

Strangury induced by the use of this agent may be treated by the use
of a solution of potassium hydrate in frequent doses from ten to twenty
drops freely diluted.

Very small doses of the tincture of cantharides—one drop diluted in
eight ounces of water—will be of sufficient strength when a patient complains of pain in passing water, or when there are intense, burning, cutting,
scalding sensations in the urethra. There may be tenesmus and urgent desire almost constant to urinate with a passing of only a drop or two at a
time, which burns like fire. There may be hematuria also.

An old German treatment for cancers was made by the use of the tincture of cantharides in a medium sized dosage, prepared in the wine of camphor with mucilage of gum arabic. A number of cures were attributed to
this.

Homeopathists give this remedy in minute doses when there is delirium
with paroxysms of rage, profanity, greatly increased sexual excitement, or

‘uror.

A prominent French writer advised cantharides in very small doses in
acute nephritis where there was at first anuria and oliguria. He gives this
in medium sized doses, claiming a rapid increase in the amount of sugar, and
disappearance in the edema.

Dr. Wark reports a case of fistula in a boy of sixteen which was cured
with a cerate of cantharides to which he added a small quantity of the tincture filling a long fistula full of this. By this means he blistered off the
pyogenic membrane of the fistula, and by simple measures healed the fistula
completely.

An application is made of a mixture of one-half of a dram of tannic
acid, one dram of tincture of cantharides, five drops of the oil of capsicum
in two ounces of glycerine rubbed thoroughly into the scalp twice a day to
prevent the falling of hair.

Dr. Thornton of Mississippi combined cantharidin and collodion and
used it in his ears for chronic deafness with excellent results.

Note—Powerful vesication is seldom deemed advisable by our physicians as local stimulation by heat or mustard is usually found sufficient. The
formation of large blisters or blebs is deprecated, as inducing depression and
local pain and general irritation, usually out of all proportion to the benefit
derived. The abstraction of the serum from the blood, which contains almost
as much albumin as the blood itself, amounts to but little less than actual
blood letting. Extreme blistering, even by physicians addicted to most
heroic measures is largely relegated to the past.

When counter irritation, derivation, or local stimulation seems to be
needed, we have recourse to local heat, dry or moist, always short of burning, mustard, capsicum, and other agents named in other chapters for their
revulsive action, as croton oil, and other oils, chloroform, ether and ammonia, confined, and dry cupping.

SPECIAL REMEDIES 471

YOHIMBE.

Part Employed—The bark of the yohimbeye tree.

ConstITUENTS—Spiegel obtained an extract of the bark, which contained a
pigment that forms, on standing in alkaline solution, two alkaloids, yohimbin
and an amorphous substance. The former crystallizes in white needles with
silky lustre, and is soluble to the extent of two per cent in water, and dissolves also in alcohol and chloroform.

The agent may be given in infusion, in the form of a powdered extract,
or the alkaloid yohimbin. A liquid extract is also prepared. The dose is
from.001 gm. to.015 gm, of the alkaloid—from the 1/60 to the 1/4 of a
grain.

Physiological Action—The action of this agent seems to be exercised directly upon the sexual centers of the spinal cord, increasing tonicity and reducing excitability.

Oberwarth and Lowy made physiological experiments on animals with
the alkaloid. After injections of 0.005 to 0.015 gm. in rabbits they observed
a swelling of the testicles and epididymis and their descent into the inguinal
canal. In dogs and cats the swelling affects rather the penis and may go so
far as to cause painful erections.

The hydrochlorate of yohimbin is a local anesthetic, of considerable
value. Used in a two per cent solution it benumbs the mucous membranes
in two minutes. In five minutes they are markedly anesthetic, and in ten
minutes the maximum degree of anesthesia is obtained. The anesthesia
lasts from one-half to three-quarters of an hour and sensation is completely
restored in an hour and a half. It does not act upon the skin when applied.
It must be injected.

Therapy—The current therapeutic journals of Austria and Germany
have contained articles on the action of this remedy for the relief of impaired sexual function. Spiegel has made some important observations on
its action. It has long been used in the form of a decoction by the natives,
to increase sexual appetite. Impotence of functional origin seems to be directly influenced by it. Silberstein of Vienna says that in so-called hypocondriacal impotence, due to morbid stimulation of the inhibitory paths, as
well as that produced by diminished excitability of the sexual centers, the
agent is successful. Patients so afflicted become violent, and may be driven
to desperation. In cases where there is a sudden failure of power, producing despondency, foreboding and general mental depression, in young married men, it is satisfactory. The knowledge of weakness has an inhibitory
effect upon the exercise of the normal functional action of the organs in
every field of their operation..

Impotence from onanism, or persistent nocturnal emissions, with loss of
appetite, was cured by this remedy in a short time. Several other cases of
a similar character were experimented on satisfactorily. In cases where the
same weakness was present with chronic alcoholism, resulting in chronic
disease of the stomach and enlargement of the liver, the agent had a satisfactory influence. Another case was cured, who, from sexual neurasthenia,
had persistent headaches.

It has been useful in operations upon the eye, nose and throat. A one
per cent solution injected is non-toxic. A writer in the Standard says that
if a two per cent solution be dropped into the conjunctival cul-de-sac, from
five to six times in fifteen minutes, it will produce both corneal and conjunctival anesthesia. The corneal anesthesia is more pronounced and lasts
much longer than the conjunctival. The eye becomes immediately suffused
and continues red for more than an hour after the last instillation. There is

moderate but marked dilatation of the pupil, which will last from fifteen to
twenty minutes. It will be found valuable in cataract extractions and iridectomy. It has also been found useful in the removal of the nasal turbinals,
and granulations, and of polypi, from the post-nasal surfaces or from the
ear.

Its great advantage is in its non-toxic properties, and that it does not
cause the tissues to contract. The hyperemia it induces, however, is a disadvantage in some cases. It does not keep well and there is some danger of
hemorrhage after an operation.

We should confirm or disapprove the observations that have been made
of this remedy. If confirmed, the agent will be a valuable addition to our
resources.

THAPSIA. THAPSIA GARGANICA.

Part Employed—tThe root.

Physiological Action—The agent is a prompt vesicant and an exceedingly active counter-irritant. In certain cases it is singularly valuable, but
the plaster must be an active one and its full influence should be obtained
in sh) four to six hours. If it acts mildly and slowly much less good will
result.

There is no pain, but in most cases an intolerable itching and if the surface is not scratched or irritated there is no spreading. It is sometimes necessary to cover the surface to prevent irritation, which may be allayed in a
short time by the application of a starch paste, or by the use of the glycerole
of starch.

Therapy—lIn stubborn, bronchial disorders Thapsia has produced immediate and permanent benefit. It is valuable in chronic lung troubles, especially where there is effusion or probability of suppuration. If the plaster
is of French manufacture, six hours is a sufficient time in which to obtain
its full effects, but if of American manufacture, it will require a longer time,
but may be equally satisfactory. It can be relied upon wherever a strong,
revulsive influence is required, and can be used in chronic inflammation of
any organ, or, in fact, wherever cantharides is indicated this remedy will
induce better results, without the drain upon the system induced by the
latter named agent..

The application of a thapsia plaster will often cure persistent cases of
sciatica, even when other measures have signally failed. In neuralgia of any
kind it is of service and will be found beneficial in some cases of muscular
rheumatism.

Because of the exceedingly irritating character of this agent, but little
use has been made of it internally, and yet some excellent authorities claim
much benefit from its action. Dudgeon speaks of this agent as a remedy for
certain urinary conditions. He says it is a powerful anti-hemorrhagic and
has a marked influence in correcting the uric acid diathesis. Rademacher
prescribed thirty drops of the tincture five times daily in a case of dropsy
with hematuria, both conditions disappearing promptly with the discharge
of a large quantity of renal sand with the urine which was greatly increased
in amount. A pupil of Rademacher gave the same dose to a woman suffering from strangury. She could not retain the urine, which was turbid, containing a red sediment and there was constant pain in the urethra, a cure
resulting within one week.

Jousset has found the remedy useful in many forms of hemorrhage.
Herr used it with success in the painful urination of old people, both with
and without spasmodic retention. It apparently acts more satisfactorily
where there is an excess of uric acid and in these cases it deserves further
trial.

UNGUENTUM ZINCI OXIDI.

Synonym—Ointment of Zinc Oxide.

Therapy—It is useful in cutaneous eruptions of all character, as it is
non-irritating and promotes rapid healing. In ulcerations, in burns, and in
excoriation, or in bruised conditions of the skin it is valuable. An ounce of
this ointment combined with two drams of bismuth sub-nitrate is a most
valuable dressing for sore nipples. It is excellent, also, applied to fissures,
oozing surfaces, eczema, and ulcerations of the anus and rectum, and to piles,
especially if of recent origin.

LANOLIN.

Synonyms—Adeps Lane Hydrosus. Hydrous wool fat.

Therapy—As an ointment base, this substance is absorbed by the skin
more rapidly than any other known base, faciliating also the absorption of
the medicinal constituents of the ointment of which it forms a part. This
author has proven this to his complete satisfaction in hundreds of cases, notwithstanding the statements of foreign experimenters, that it has no superior
influence. It is soothing to the skin and healing to a remarkable extent and
preceptibly promotes the growth of hair. An ointment, of which this is the
base, applied to a given surface for thirty days will show a marked increase
in the growth of the hair as compared with that on the surrounding surface.

Viburnin, a greenish-yellow, bitter principal, resinous, soluble in alcohol, sparingly soluble in water.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum viburni prunifolii fluidum, fluid extract of
viburnum prunifolium. Dose, from half a dram to one dram.

Specific Medicine Viburnum. Dose, from five to sixty minims.

Physiological Action—Its influence is exercised upon the womb, regulating its function and soothing irritation. The agent has not had thorough
study to determine its exact physiological action. It however exercises its
influence through the nervous centers, soothing nerve irritation and possessing marked antispasmodic properties. It influences the motor side of the
cord, producing progressive muscular weakness, loss of reflex action and ultimate paralysis. It apparently directly influences the action of the heart, as
it lowers arterial pressure to a marked degree.

Its sedative influence upon the nervous system is conveyed to the uterus
and appendages and there becomes apparent. It overcomes all forms of
nervous irritation, and irregular functional action in these organs. It is the
direct remedy for nervous conditions of the pregnant state.

Therapy—It is the remedy for dysmenorrhea, especially that characterized by cramp-like pains of spasmodic character. It promotes normal uterine
contractions and antagonizes those of an irregular character. It is valuable
in menorrhagia and metrorrhagia, either of an acute or a passive character.
In all of these cases its use should be begun a few days in advance of the
anticipated disorder and continued through and beyond the menstrual period.

Viburnum prunifolium is especially a uterine sedative in threatened miscarriage. It is particularly indicated in habitual abortion, preventing an
anticipated occurrence and permanently overcoming the habit. I have had
practical experience extending over thirty years, and have perfect confidence
in the agent based on repeated success. In one of my cases it caused the
womb to suspend explusive action and to retain a dead fetus for months;
given in large doses after the fourth month no return of the expulsive effort
occurred until the seventh, when the agent was discontinued, after which a
four-months mummified fetus was expelled without detriment to the health
of the patient. She had decreased in size since the fourth month and there
was no fetal movement. The agent, when there is no habit of abortion, will
probably accomplish the desired result if begun after hemorrhage has continued some hours, if the membranes are not detached or the sac ruptured.

AGENTS ACTING ON THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS 475

Doses of one dram of the fluid extract every hour are necessary until
the pain subsides or the flow ceases. The patient must be kept in a recumbent position and perfectly quiet. It is safer to begin either preceding, or
with the flow in these cases.

In habitual cases it is necessary to give the agent in occasional doses for
one, two or more weeks preceding the time of the miscarriage, which usually
occurs each time at the same month of the foetal life. As the time approaches
the patient is kept quiet and free from excitement, and the agent is given
three or four times daily. The interval is shortened to one or two hours with
the first suspicious indications at the usual time. If no symptoms appear the
agent is continued beyond the period, and then perhaps in daily doses only
for a week or two longer. The physician should advise the patient to remain
constantly on the watch for indications suggesting the necessity of an increase in the doses. The agent will stop induced miscarriage, as well as other
forms, if no injury has been done to the membranes.

In small doses, it is an excellent partus preparator, materially improving
the conditions when irregular and distressing symptoms are present and
greatly facilitating a speedy and uncomplicated normal labor. It controls
after pains and prevents post-partum hemorrhage. It insures normal involution and assists in retaining a normal position of the womb subsequently,
where malposition had previously existed.

In its influence in overcoming reflex nervous disturbances, it is often
most efficient in controlling the morning sickness of pregnancy and the entire
train of distressing symptoms present at this time. It changes the mental
condition of the patient from that of depression and despondency, to one of
cheerfulness and hopefulness.

There is probably no proprietary remedy advertised for female complaints, and for promiscuous use in cases of this character, that does not contain viburnum prunifolium as the basic remedy. Its field of usefulness is a
wide one as far as the genito-urinary apparatus is concerned.

It is the remedy for sympathetic disturbances of the heart, stomach and
nervous system, common to sensitive ladies with irritable nervous systems,
preceding or during the menstrual epoch, depending on vasomotor derangement. It must be given in advance and continued through the period.

In a number of cases, when given for menstrual irregularities, or for the
distress induced by uterine displacement, in previously sterile females, pregnancy has promptly occurred, proving the influence of the agent in restoring normal functional ovarian activity.

It must not be overlooked in the treatment of irregular sudden, menstrual flow, occurring during eruptive and low continued or violent inflammatory fevers, especially in young ladies. This occurrence is not uncommon
in smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles, pneumonitis, pleuritis, phthisis
and typhoid fever. It is sometimes of serious import, and masked sepsis
undoubtedly occurs in the cases, with severe peritonitis or metritis, to
which the patient may succumb. With antiseptic douches and disinfectant
measures, viburnum internally is the surest remedy known, in this condition.
It is given in conjunction with other indicated remedies, and its use must be
begun promptly upon the appearance of the flow.

Virburnum is well classed among the tonics, as there is usually a general
improvement in all the body functions while it is taken which is usually
permanent. It has a very satisfactory effect upon derangements of the stom-

‘ ach and intestinal tract, especially in females when the whole system is out
of tone. It restores the nerve influence, improves the circulation, supplies
nutrition to the womb and ovaries. It is valuable in dysmenorrhea which is
due to debility.

476 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

It is mildly efficacious in irregular muscular movements, in chorea, especially if occurring from early menstrual derangement, and in some cases of
paralysis agitans.

It is advised in hysteria, hystero-epilepsy, and petit mal, but its influence
is mild. It will act in harmony with macrotys and passiflora and the bromides in these cases. It is an agent of great usefulness, and its field broadens
with every practitioner, as his knowledge of its influence increases with
practical experience in its use.

VIBURNUM. VIBURNUM OPULUS.

Synonyms—Cramp Bark, High Cranberry, High-bush Cranberry.

PREPARATIONS—Fluid Extract High Cranberry. Dose, from ten to thirty

Specific Symptomatolgy—The specific influence of the agent is exercised in relieving irregular spasmodic pains of the womb and ovaries. It is
antispasmodic in its action upon the entire pelvic viscera, influencing spasmodic contractions of the muscular structure of the bladder, and spasmodic
stricture to a limited extent.

One of its specific indications is pain from the pelvic organs which begin
in the back, extending through to the loins and down the thighs. This is
corrected with twenty drops every hour or two. If this is accompanied with
severe or profuse menstruation with a sensation of dragging weight in the
back, the pains extending clear around the body, a drop or two of macrotys
or ten drops of helonias with every dose will relieve the pain.

Therapy—Given prior to labor it is a partus preparator of much value,
but its action is limited largely to its antispasmodic influence upon erratic
pains. It is given with much benefit in severe after-pains, in hysterical conditions, with convulsive phenomena, and in spasmodic dysmenorrhea. It
is of advantage in that it prevents miscarriage, but to an extent greatly
inferior to viburnum prunifolium, which agent, in fact, fully covers the
field of operation of this agent, except in its anti-spasmodie influence.

SENECIO. SENECIO AUREUS.

Synonym—Life Root.

ConstITUENTS—A bitter, acid principle, tannin, mucilage.

PrEPARATIONS—Extractum Senecionis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Senecio.
Dose, from half a dram to one dram. Specific Medicine Senecio. Dose, from
one to forty minims.

Physiological Action—Its specific influence is exercised upon the reproductive organs of the female, whether there be amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea,
menorrhagia or metrorrhagia—a disordered conditions of the uterine functions—it is regulated by this agent; a general out-of-tone condition of the
uterus or appendages, a relaxed condition of the supports to the womb,
resulting in mild forms of displacement. It may be given between or during
the menstrual periods. In a general hyperemic, irritable and atonic condition of the pelvic organs, it works to the best advantage. The results are
not immediate, but they are marked when they do occur.

It is of value in engorged, atonic conditions of the male sexual organs
also; it increases functional activity, and is of value in impotency, although
but mildly so. It is a reliable diuretic. It adds tone to, and increases the
function of the urinary apparatus, and overcomes urinary irritation; in stranguary it has a direct influence.

AGENTS ACTING ON THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS ATT

Therapy—The agent is specifically a tonic to the nervous and muscular
structure of the reproductive organs in the female. It regulates the periodical discharges, overcoming irregularity in the quantity of the monthly flow.
It will render valuable assistance in the permanent cure of leucorrhea, It
removes the sensation of weight and engorgement experienced by many
ladies in pelvic disorders, especially accompanying uterine displacements,
giving great relief.

It will be found of value in gonorrhea, gleet and prostatorrhea, and also
in the sexual irritability and impotence of the male.

Senecio has an influence on the mucous surfaces, relieving congestion and
correcting catarrhal disorders. It assists digestion, stimulates the secretion
of gastric fluids and overcomes the conditions which cause the food to lie
heavily in the stomach. In the accumulation of frothy saliva it is useful
and in a constipation accompanying uterine disorders it is especially valuable.

The agent has exercised an active influence in a number of cases of capillary hemorrhage. It has been given in hematuria in spoonful doses of the
fluid extract, three or four times a day, with positive results. In albuminuria,
with occasional attacks of hematuria, especially if occurring during pregnancy, the agent will act promptly. In hemorrhage of the lungs, or from the
stomach of a passive character, it will work well. In menorrhagia or
metrorrhagia it is directly indicated.

Co-operatives—In acts in -harmony with viburnum, helonias, aralia,
mitchella repens, and other agents of this character.

HELONIAS. HELONIAS DIOICA.

Synonyms—Chamelirium Luteum (Gray), Starwort.

ConstITvENts—Chamelirin, fatty acid.

PreEPARATIONS—Extractum Heloniatis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Helonias.
Dose, from five to thirty minims. Specific Medicine Helonias. Dose, from
one to twenty minims. Helonin. Dose, from two to five grains.

Physiological Action—Helonias in large doses is a cardiac poison. In
medicinal doses it is emetic, tonic, diuretic, vermifuge. Cattle are killed by
feeding on it and the decoction will kill insects.

Specific Symptomatology—The most direct indication for the use of this
agent is a dragging sensation in the extreme lower abdomen, and inclination
to pull up, to hold up, or support the abdominal pelvic contents. In women
suffering from pelvic engorgement and uterine prolapsus, with disordered
menstruation, one drop of the tincture or fluid extract every two or three
hours will relieve that sensation permanently.

Therapy—Homeopathists believe helonias to be particularly suitable for
female disorders, where there is feeble constitution, where the nervous system is weakened and the patient is easily fatigued. It is restorative, promotes
nutrition, promotes secretion of healthy fluids. It is peculiarly tonic.

Where disorders of the stomach are present with uterine or kidney disease, it should exercise a direct action. It cures amenorrhea and menorrhagia which depend on uterine atony. Where malpositions occur from
weakness—loss of tone—where there is dragging sensation constantly present in the lower abdomen, or at the menstrual epoch, it is directly indicated.
For the case of the worn mother who watches over the care of her charge, as
well as for the young girl budding into womanhood, carefully and properly
selected, this remedy will certainly give satisfactory results..

It is a pure and active restorative; is nutritious and promotes secretion;
it promotes normal activity of the glandular organs. When glandular action

478 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

is prevented, from the influence of uterine or renal disease, it is especially
serviceable. The underlying indication is uterine atony.

It will cure amenorrhea, menorrhagia, some cases of leucorrhea, and the
dragging down sensations in the lower abdomen, which results from simple
displacements. It will also relieve erratic pains of stomach and gastric disorders which depend upon or accompany this condition.

Wherever there is a tendency to uterine displacements, it should be
used. If these disorders are present with threatened abortion, the remedy
should be combined with viburnum, and both be given in full doses to prevent that condition. It, however, works more perfectly in combination with
aletris farinosa and macrotys in atonic conditions, while caulophyllum and
vibernum act best where irritable conditions are present. The remedy will
also control hemorrhages of a passive character.

In addition, it is a general tonic improving the character of all the
organs in their functional operations, and especially improving the tone of
the digestive apparatus. It is a liver remedy of rare value, in many cases
accomplishing most satisfactory results when there is deficient or perverted

A number of our physicians have spoken most highly of its action in
albuminuria. It will be found valuable in those cases where the cause is
some fault of the liver, as deficient action of that organ, and not due to heart
or circulatory faults.

A number of excellent observers have confirmed this statement. Dr. S. B.
Munn of Connecticut used it for many years with very satisfactory
results. From another observation its influence would be improved in certain cases by the addition of phytolacca and where there is marked toxemia
by echinacea.

If the sensation of dragging and weight occurs in the male from cystic
disorder, the relief is fully as satisfactory. The general action of the agent
in these cases is that of a tonic to the genito-urinary apparatus. It quickly
overcomes the phosphatic diathesis, and in urinary irritability is serviceable,
especially if from atonic causes. It is useful in impotence, and its properties
as an aphrodisiac have been often noted.

MITCHELLA. MITCHELLA REPENS.

Synonyms—Partridgeberry, Squaw Vine.

ConstiTuENTs—Saponin-like, resin, wax, dextrine, mucilage.

PREPARATIONS—Specifiec Mitchella. Dose, from five to sixty minims.
Syrupus Mitchelle compositus, compound syrup of Mitchella. Dose, from one
to two drams.

Therapy—The sphere of action of mitchella is upon the reproductive
organs, particularly upon those of the female. It is not enlarged upon by our
writers, but is known positively to a few practitioners. It is par excellence
the partus preparator. The importance of removing every possible influence
that increases in any way the severity of labor, does not impress itself upon
physicians, unless an exceedingly severe labor is anticipated, when the excess
pain is alleviated at the time by chloroform and morphine. Not only can all
complicating influences be removed, but the nervous system can be so influenced that parturition to the mother can be shorn of dread and terrors, and
can be looked forward to without anxiety or fear. We are so apt to think
of the pain and horror of labor as a natural inheritance for each mother—
something that she must expect, and should not try to shun, that we do not
take the care we could in many cases, to shield her from it.

SPECIAL UTERINE REMEDIES 479

If a good preparation of mitchella be administered once or twice daily for
the sixth and seventh months of pregnancy, three times daily for the eighth
month, and in larger doses as confinement approaches, the influence upon the
entire system will be most marked. I have observed this influence in so many
cases that doubt is impossible. Erratic pains and unsatisfied longings are removed, the nervous system assumes a tranquil condition, reflex symptoms
abate, the urinary function is performed normally, the bowels become regular,
imperfect digestion is improved, and the appetite becomes natural. Labor
approaches, devoid of the irritating, aggravating complications, the preparatory stage is simple, the dilatation is completed quickly, the expulsive contractions are strong, unirritating, and effectual, and are much less painful than
without the remedy; involution is rapid and perfect, there are no subsequent complicating conditions to contend with, the patient’s strength is not
abated, and the function of lactation is in its best condition. This has been
proven in very many cases. After making the above statements, evidences
accumulated rapidly confirming their truth.

Auxiliary measures such as judicious dieting, a thorough oiling of the
enlarged abdomen, and an occasional hot sitz bath for the last few weeks
will materially assist the remedy. Less of it need be taken.

The bark of the fresh root in hot infusion given occasionally during the
progress of labor when no previous care of the patient has been afforded the
physician, will work wonders in some tedious aggravating cases.

In uterine disorders at other times this agent is a most effectual remedy.
It overcomes painful menstruation, regulates the function, relieves congestion in the pelvic organs and soothes general irritation of the nervous system
from uterine or ovarian causes.

Dr. Hemminger of Pennsylvania uses mitchella to prevent abortion. He
gives it in twenty drop doses three times a day. In two years he had six
eases that had aborted from one to three times each, always with dead children. With the use of this medicine, each of the six gave birth to a healthy
child. The medicine was given throughout the entire period of gestation.

Co-Operatives—It works harmoniously with cimicifuga, pulsatilla,
aletris, helonias, senecio aureus, and viburnum. Combinations of these agents
compose the usual proprietary compounds, advertised as ‘‘female reguators.

ALETRIS. ALETRIS FARINOSA.

Synonym—Star Grass, unicorn root, ague root.

ConstTITUENTS—Not analyzed.

PrREPARATIONS—Extractum Aletridis Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Aletris.
Dose, from ten to fifteen minims.,

Specific Medicine Aletris. Dose, from one to sixty minims.

Action—Emetic, narcotic, cathartic, tonic.

Aletridin. Dose, from one-half to one grain.

Specific Symptomatology—The conspicuous influence of this agent is
upon the womb. It is indicated when the patient complains of extreme
weakness in the uterine structures, when there is general feebleness induced
from overwork or from oversexual indulgence, or from too frequent childbearing. In hyperactivity of the womb and ovaries from lack of tone, deficient menstruation, or sterility from this cause, pale insufficient flow at protracted intervals; anemia and chlorosis, with insufficient menses in young
girls, the agent is of great service.

Therapy—In the above named condition when iron or other tonics are
used for their general influence, this remedy should be given for its specific


<!-- chunk -->

480 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

effect. Its direct influence upon the pelvic organs is sometimes magical
under such circumstances. Aletris, in large doses, is narcotic, emetic and
cathartic. It is a fine tonic and is efficient in flatulent colic and dyspepsia,
increasing the tone of the stomach; used also with benefit in general and
local debility. It is a host in hysteria.

One of our correspondents says he has frequently given aletris in cases
of threatening abortion, for three, four, five and six months, the woman
going her full term without any untoward effect, rendering the labor easy
and safe. In chlorisis, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and all engorged conditions of the uterus, as well as prolapsus of that organ, it is a charming remedy. It can be given alone, or combined or alternated with caulophyllum, or
with macrotys, senecio or helonias as indicated.

“TI have often combined aletris and viburnum opulus, or viburnum
prunifolium. The viburnum will allay pain; both ae sedative to the uterine
and ovarian nerve centers. I do not know of ahy better remedy for such
troubles than aletris and viburnum as anti-abortive. The dose is the same
of viburnum opulus and viburnum prunifolium. It is a valuable remedy for
uterine colic and other abdominal pains. Hence in ovarian irritation, or
dysmenorrhea, viburnum will promptly relieve the pain.

“Flatulent colic is quickly relieved with equal parts of the fluid extracts
of aletris, and dioscorea; ten drops given every hour; if the first dose does
not relieve, which it often does, repeat. In leucorrhea, aletris, four times a
day, or every four hours, will act promptly, if continued, where there is a
debilitated condition, defective nutrtion and anemia. If there is pain in the
hips and back, constipation and piles, asculus hippocastanum can alternate
with the aletris.’’

It acts promptly upon prolapsus or retro or ante-version with relaxed
and enfeebled tissues. In emaciated and enfeebled women the influence of
this remedy is markedly conspicuous. It improves the function of the
ovaries, overcoming sterility and correcting habitual abortion promptly. In
the extreme nausea of pregnancy with vomiting, dizziness, or fainting spells,
this agent has a direct influence and may be relied upon.

It is not sufficiently well known, but is a constituent of many of the
proprietary ‘‘mother’s cordials’’ or ‘‘female restoratives’’ on the market. It
acts exceedingly well with helonias, senecio aureus, viburnum, and caulophyllum or cimicifuga.

While given for its influence upon the reproductive organs, it tones the
stomach, increases the appetite, improves the digestion and the appropriation
of food, and thus directly promotes the elaboration of good blood.

CAULOPHYLLUM. CAULOPHYLLUM THALICTROIDES.

Synonym—Blue Cohosh.

ConstiTvENTs—Caulophyllin, leontin, two resins, gum, tannin.

Preparations—Caulophyllin. Dose, from one-fourth to one grain. Extractum Caulophyllum Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Caulophyllum. Dose, five to
ten minims.

Specific Medicine Caulophyllum. Dose, from one to ten minims.

It is often necessary to continue this remedy, in whatever form given,
over a considerable period of time in order to obtain its best results.

Specific Symptomatology—Felter and Lloyd give the following indications: Uterine pain, with fullness, weight and pain in the legs, fullness of
tissues, as if congested; debility of the nervous system, with impaired mus-

SPECIAL UTERINE REMEDIES. 481

cular power; spasmodic muscular pains, articular pain, rheumatic pains of
asthenic plethora, epigastric and umbilical colicky pains, dull frontal headache, great thirst; as an oxytocic; to relieve false pains and uterine irritability; sexual debility, with excitablity; spasmodic uterine contractions, dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation, cramp-like pains in the stomach and
bowels after eating, pain in the toes and fingers not due to tissue changes.

Therapy—In chronic uterine disorders, in broken down constitutions
with various reflex symptoms, the remedy is a specific. In the amenorrhea
of young women, at the commencement of the menstrual period, it may be
given with confidence. In painful menstruation it has an established reputation.

Dr. Hewitt of Chicago learned when a boy the use of caulophyllum in
scarlet fever. When he byeame a physician, he put that knowledge to test
very many times and alwa¥s with success. He has positive confidence in this
remedy, having seen such uniformly good results.

From the end of the sixth month to the close of pregnancy is a period
when many distressing symptoms are manifested, which may, in a measure,
be relieved by caulophyllum.

The growth of the fetus has been compared to an apple, which, when
fully ripened, falls from the tree. The effect of caulophyllum is to prolong
gestation till the foetus is fully developed, labor being a physiological process
at full term, and not pathological, therefore less protracted, less painful, and
less liable to accidents.

Many writers confirm the opinion that caulophyllum or caulophillin are
excellent remedies in labor, contributing to the relaxation of a rigid os, increasing the strength of the pains. It will also assist materially in controlling an abortion. Using it in conjunction with viburnum, this influence will
be enhanced.

This remedy as a partus preparator is equal in some cases to macrotys,
and comparable with viburnum and helonias. It prevents premature delivery
by a superior tonicity, which it induces in all the reproduetive organs. It
has caused many cases to overrun their time a few days, and yet easy labors
and excellent recoveries have followed. It is a satisfactory remedy where
there is a habit of having severe after pains, or where there are false labor
pains, not productive of good, or where subsequent to the labor there are
hourglass or other undue spasmodic uterine contractions.

It is a beneficial remedy in hysteria, and where there is constant ovarian
irritation, or pain in the mammary glands, accompanied with general irritation; also in chronic disease of the uterus and ovaries or of the cervix.
Also where there is cramp-like pains during menstruation or pain and soreness of the uterus, attributed to rheumatism. It is of much benefit in subinvolution.

Caulophyllum, although chiefly known as a remedy for the diseases peculiar to women, has been employed with advantage as a sedative and to control congestion, in bronchitis, pneumonitis and whooping-cough.

In deficient labor pains, caulophyllum is generally a reliable remedy.

A sufficient dose of the remedy may be given every ten minutes, till the
pains become regular and efficient.

FRAXINUS. FRAXINUS AMERICANA.

Synonyms—Black Ash, Elder Leaved Ash, or White Ash.

PrREPARATIONS—Specific fraxinus, ten to sixty drops. The Homeopathic
mother tincture, same dosage.


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 475

482 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Specific Symptomatology—Uterine disease, depending upon sub-involution. Dragging pains in the lower abdomen—great weight; a sensation of
hardness extending into the vagina; irregular lochial or menstrual discharge j general plethora; constant headaches, with soreness and pain in the
top head.

Accompanying these symptoms there is a sore spot on the top of the
head which is hot, and where if continued the hair becomes stiff and brittle.

This is often accompanied with persistent headache difficult to control.
The headache is not influenced by eating or sleeping. It resembles an anemic
headache as it is more or less constant, unless relieved by the recumbent
position or by a position in which the hips are raised and the head lowered.

Therapy—In uterine diseases, where there is no permanent organic
change, Dr. Shafer gave this remedy first place. He used it for several
years, and his observations should carry weight. It is indicated in uterine
tumors, of somewhat speedy growth, and in hypertrophy of the uterus.
Where the tumors are of long-standing its influence is less satisfactory. It
influences cell proliferation in hypertrophy, assisting in the reduction of size
of an enlarged organ and in the restoration of a correct position, normal function and normal size.

One patient had a sensation of much weight in the lower abdomen with
a sensation of hardness extending down into the vagina, pressure in the rectum, hard and enlarged cervix, greatly enlarged womb, constant sensations
of desire to pass urine with no relief when passed. The organ was reduced
to normal size in four months’ time, by the persistent use of twenty minim
doses of this remedy four times daily. No other agent was used.

Another case of hypertrophy, resulting from a miscarriage, was as satisfactorily cured. Cases of subinvolution, following a poor getting up, after
labor, were satisfactorily cured with this remedy alone. The agent must be
given immediately following confinement in those cases where convalescence
threatens to be protracted.

One young lady, severely injured by falling from a carriage, had severe
uterine inflammation, which left chronic enlargement, as its result. She had
been told that hysterectomy only would cure. The organ was enlarged to
six times its usual size, though she was only eighteen years old. She was
completely cured with this remedy alone.

Prior to the use of this remedy, for uterine disorders, it was recommended as one that influences the chylopoietic viscera. In large doses it will
induce active purgation. It has found a place in the treatment of diseases
of the liver or spleen, in that form known as ague cake, resulting in obesity,
dropsical affections and constipation.

POLYGONUM. POLYGONUM PUNCTATUM.

Synonym—Smart-weed.

ConstiTuENTS—Not analyzed.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Polygonum. Dose, from one to sixty minims.

Therapy—In suppression of the menses from cold, thirty drops in hot
water may be drunk every two hours. It is a prompt remedy. It may be
begun two weeks before the menses should next appear, if one period has
passed, and given every four hours in cold water, until a day or two before
the expected time, when it can again be given in hot water. It acts well, also,
when there is general plethora.

More recently, I have used it in conjunction with one or two of the other
uterine remedies, carefully selected, in all forms of menstrual suppression,

SPECIAL UTERINE REMEDIES 483

except in feeble and anemic patients, and have found it efficient and readily
controllable.

It acts promptly upon the skin and kidneys and seems to be to a certain
extent antispasmodic, as in hystero-epilepsy, or epilepsy depending upon suppression of the menses, it relieves the paroxysms and reduces the number of
the attacks.

Goss recommended it when there was urinary suppression from cold and
in retention with lack of power in the bladder.

_In certain forms of flatulent colic, when the pains are sharp and lancinating, intermittent, and of a severe griping character, it is curative.

LEONUROUS. LEONURUS CARDIACA.

Synonym—Motherwort.

ConstITUENTS—Bitter principle, volatile oil.

PrEPARATIONS—Extractum Leonuri Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Leonurus.
Dose, from a half to two drams.

Specific Symptomatology—This agent is positive in suppressed lochia
from any cause, amenorrhea from cold; dysmenorrhea, with morbid nervous
excitability, and hysteria.

Prof. John King regarded motherwort as superior to all other remedies
in suppression of the lochia, giving it internally and applying a fomentation
of the herb over the lower abdominal region. The author has used it with
excellent results. _

Therapy—It is prescribed in the above conditions, also in delirium tremens, typhoid state in fevers, chronic diseases with wakefulness, restlessness,
disturbed sleep, spinal irritation, neuralgia of the stomach and head, feeble
digeston, general debility, chorea, convulsions, nervousness from irregular
menstruation, palpitation of the heart, associated with uterine disease, amenorrhea, with ehlorosis, cachexia and an irritable, excitable, enfeebled state of
the nervous system, spasms and harrassing bearing down pains, and morbid
sensibility from uterine disease, pain in the pelvic and lumbar regions in
females.

Dr. Dawes of England uses leonurus for its action upon the heart. It is
a simple heart tonic, promoting normal action, probably very mild in its influence. It would work well combined with cactus or crataegus or both, especially in the presence of nux vomica or collinsonia.

Motherwort is tonic and laxative, a diaphoretic somewhat like asclepias,
an emmenagogue like cimicifuga and a nervine like scutellaria.

GOSSYPIUM. GOSSYPIUM HERBACEUM.

Synonym—Cotton.

ConstITUENTsS—<An acrid resin, glucose, starch, fixed oil, tannin.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Gossypii Radicis Fluidum. Fluid Extract of
Cotton-root Bark. Dose, from one-half to one dram. Specific Medicine
Gossypium. Dose, from five to twenty minims. Purified cotton (Surgeon’s
cotton), collodion.

Therapy—Gossypium is used as an emmenagogue and parturient.

It has a wide reputation among the slave women of the South as an abortifacient. It was used by them in the form of a strong infusion of the green
root and is of value in suppression of the mensis from whatever cause. It
produces firm, regular and strong uterine contractions, much resembling

ustilago maydis and cimicifuga in its action. It may be used in uterine
inertia to increase the natural expulsive power of the womb and prevent the
dangers of post-partum hemorrhage. It is a hemostatic of some power being
used principally to control the hemorrhage of uterine fibroids and incipient
cancer. It is a valuable agent for metrorrhagia and menorrhagia, but is not
in general use, as the uterine tonics and stimulants in common use accomplish these results in their wider beneficial influence.

TIGER LILY. LILIUM TIGRINUM.

PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Tiger Lily. Dose, from one to ten minims.

Physiological Action—In 1863 Dr. Jeffries Wyman reported a case in
which vomiting, purging, drowsiness, ete., were believed to have been produced in a little girl by the pollen of the tiger lily.

Tiger Lily seems to act upon the sympathetic nerves of the pelvis, increasing their strength and tone. It operates through the spinal cord,
decreasing sexual irritability and materially improving the pelvic circulation.
This influence is exercised best when the uterus and ovaries are greatly
engorged and if there be displacement or subinvolution. Those conditions
which occur from getting up too soon after confinement are improved by it,
and those where the parts are slow in recovering tone, from any cause, or
daa there is danger of permanent prolapse from engorgement, are benefited

y it.

Specific Symptomatology—Neuralgic pain in the uterus, ovaries, and
mamme, acid leucorrhea excoriating to the labia, causing an eruption
about the vulva and inflammation of the vagina; nausea from uterine disease or pregnancy; headache from uterine disease; nervous sick-headache;
chronic inflammation of the uterus, with displacement; tedious recovery after
child-birth; amenorrhea, with burning pain in the ovaries; distress about the
heart, with prolapse of the uterus; pain under the left breast; dysmenorrhea;
neuralgic pain in the uterus and ovaries extending down the inside of the
thighs; a sense of weight and downward pressure in the lower abdomen;
uterine displacements in general from debility.

Therapy—These symptoms of uterine disease, cured or relieved by tiger
lily, show the action of the remedy within a limited sphere; but it is probable
that it has a much wider range of action, as we find that the common white
meadow lily was employed by the early settlers in this country as a general
and local tonic in prolapsus uteri; and as a tonic in debilitated states of the
female organs of generation, and in dropsy, while the root of the white pond
lily was used as a local application to ulcers and inflammations.

Prof. John King says:

**T recollect a lady who, several years since, was pronounced by several
physicians to have uterine cancer, and which resisted all their treatment;
she was permanently cured by a squaw, who gave her to drink freely of the
decoction of a root, as well as to inject it in the vagina, which proved to be
that of the white pond lily—Nuphar Alba.”’

Guided by the influence of these agents on the symptoms of disease, and
by the diseases cured or relieved by them, we conclude that their action is
similar.

Dr. Baldwin, of Michigan, uses the fluid extract of Nuphar Lutea in the
local treatment of chronic uterine disease of whatever character or however
severe, with the most gratifying results. His experience has extended over
several years. The preparation is applied in full strength with cotton or
on a tampon..

SPECIAL UTERINE REMEDIES 485
CYPRIPEDIUM. CYPRIPEDIUM PUBESCENS.

Synonym—Yellow Ladies’ Slipper.

ConstTITUENTS—V olatile oil, volatile acid, two resins, starch, fixed oil, sugar.

PrREPARATIONS—Extractum Cypripedii Fluidum, Fluid Extract of Cypripedium. Dose, from ten to thirty minims.

Oleo-resin of Cypripedium. Dose, from one to three grains.

Specific Cypripedium. Dose, from five to sixty minims.

Administration—It must be given in rather large doses. A preparation
of the fresh root should be employed, as it loses its propertics by drying.

The best results have been reported when doses of fifteen grains of the
powdered root have been given, but from one to four grains every three or
fous hours is usually sufficient to relieve the nervous symptoms of typhoid

ever,

Specific Symptomatology—The conditions in which this agent has been
used may be summed us as follows: Nervousness, restlessness with constant
change of position, irascibility, abnormal excitability, sleeplessness, nervous
irritation from atony, neuralgia, delirium, nervousness of infants, hypochondriasis, morbid sensitiveness of the eyes, nervousness from long illness,
abnormal irritability, nervousness from over-exertion of the mind, hysteria,
delirium tremens, nervous headache, nervousness from gastro-intestinal irritation, irritation of the brain in young children with threatened convulsions.

Therapy—Cypripedium exercises a special influence upon nervous conditions induced by or depending upon disorders of the female genito-urinary
organs. Hysteria, melancholia, restlessness with morbid excitability, sleeplessness, and pain from general hyperesthesia induced by uterine or ovarian
disorder will be benefited by this remedy. It will also relieve mental depression from spermatorrhea and venereal excesses, acting somewhat like
pulsatilla.

With children it allays cerebral hyperemia from teething, irritation of
the brain in scrofulous children, with nervousness and sleeplessness, and irritation in cases in which the mental faculties are prematurely developed.

It may be used in morbid vigilance, and jactitation in typhoid fever,
typhomania and great sinking of the vital powers in adynamic fevers, also
where there is morbid depression from chronic dyspepsia.

Cypripedium stimulates the nervous system in a moderate degree, and
is suitable for cases where nervousness is the chief feature. It will relieve
pain where restlessness and nervousness are associated with headache or
neuralgia. Under its influence these patients become cheerful, and the
nervous agitation disappears..

The action of cypripedium is feeble, and relieves only functional
derangement.

In scrofulous children its action is only temporary, and the syrup of calcium phosphate, with Fowler’s solution, and cod-liver oil may be added to
the treatment to overcome the constitutional tendency to development of
tubercular disease.

ARALIA.; ARALIA RACEMOSA.

Synonym—American Spikenard.
ConstITUENTS—Volatile oil, resin, sugar, pectin, starch.. ‘PREPARATIONS—Specific Medicine Spikenard. Dose, from five to forty

rhea. Acrid leucorrhea with an offensive odor. Bearing down pain from
prolapsus uteri. Indolent, irritable, fetid ulcers.

Therapy—The agent is also prescribed with advantage in asthmatic
breathing, humid asthma, hay-fever, bronchitis, and laryngitis in the early
stage, coughs and colds, earache and deafness.

Chronic pulmonary complaints, phthisis, scrofulous enlargement of
glands, chronic catarrh, pain in the stomach in gouty subjects, rheumatism,
syphilis. Cachectic conditions are bencfited by this remedy, also irritation of
the bladder and kidneys, with scanty urine.

Aralia racemosa is stimulant and diaphoretic with a special affinity for
the respiratory organs. It may be given to produce perspiration in the early
stages of coughs and colds and to asthmatic patients whose complaint is aggravated by catarrh from taking cold.

In chronic complaints of the uric acid or gouty diathesis, and in syphilis,
it increases waste, removes morbific products from the system, and gives
tone to all the organs.

As a local application in chronic ulcers and chronic skin diseases it is
both stimulant and antiseptic.

In foul smelling and acrid leucorrhea, used as an injection, it acts as a
disinfectant and may be employed to advantage.

A preparation made from the fresh root should always be employed, to
get the best results.

GROUP xX.

Agents Acting Upon Micro-Organisms and Parasites.

IODOFORM. RESORCINOL. FORMALDEHYDE.
ARISTOL. GUAIACOL. SULPHUR.
BORIC ACID. GUAIACOL CARBONATE, SULPHUROUS ACID.
CREOSOTE. POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE. ARSENITE OF COPPER.
PHENOL. PEROXIDE OF HYDROGEN. SALICYLATE OF BISMUTH.
IODOFORM.

Formula—CHI,.

Synonyms—Triiodomethane, diiodomethyl-iodide, formyl] iodide.

Physiological Action—In its application to open sores and wounds Iodoform is not likely to produce constitutional effects, and yet poisoning has occurred. The symptoms of such an occurrence are usually a feeling of great
lassitude, nausea, vomiting and the perception of odors not present (olfactory hallucination). There are headache, insomnia, rapid pulse, and cerebral excitement. In one case where the writer had freely applied an Iodoform ointment on a large burned surface for several days, there were
trembling, cold sweat and a noisy, excitable, mirthful mania for several
hours. There is apt to be urinary suppression, or hematuria. These symptoms may be followed by coma and death. There is a marked difference in
the susceptibility of different patients to its toxic influence. The aged are
especially susceptible and children are less liable to be unpleasantly
affected.

The influence of this agent upon disease germs is not great but it is
actively antiseptic. In this it is unique. It is asserted that it does not prevent the growth and development of pathogenic germs in culture media; that
it is not always sterile, but it is sometimes capable of conveying disease. Its
beneficial influence is explained in the face of these facts by the assertion
that it is decomposed in the presence of germ development, and the product
of this decomposition, acting upon the ptomaines, one of the products of
germ growth, renders them inert, innocuous. In this manner it is asserted
to control or inhibit suppuration. In some cases it is necessary to render
iodoform sterile by washing it with a sterilizing solution.

Therapy—lIodoform, then, is not the remedy for poisoned or septic
wounds. It is the poison here introduced that we have to contend with
usually and not the ptomaine induced by the processes of the growth of a
germ of disease..

It is of service in discharging wounds, open offensive ulcers and putrid
sores. There was, a few years ago, no agent of more general use as @ surgical
dressing than this. It has more recently been superceded by agents devoid
of its objectionable odor. It is not considered especially efficacious in promoting granulation, in fact it has been declared to retard this process, but
it prevents most effectually the influence of disease germs upon the open
surfaces. Los

It is useful in nearly all surgical operations. Its great objectionable
feature is its offensive and penetrating odor.

It is serviceable made into a vaginal suppository which contains five
grains, for introduction immediately after labor and following antiseptic
douches. In isolated cases the patient, in the absence of an attendant, can
be persuaded to introduce a suppository into the vagina morning and night,
especially if there be a denuded mucous surface or a slight laceration, or if
there has been an operation for laceration.

Suppositories of iodoform may be introduced into the rectum in the treatment of fissures, ulcers, or hemorrhoids, to an excellent advantage.

The use of iodoform in tubercular conditions has followed naturally
upon the development of the knowledge of its antagonistic influence toward
tubercular bacilli. In Europe it was injected into the lung structure through
the chest walls in the form of a one per cent solution in sweet almond oil,
but few in this country adopted so extreme a measure.

Its use with us is confined to tubercular caries of the joints, tubercular
deposits of the skin, and pus sacs from the presence of tubercular deposits.
The pus is evacuated under strict antiseptic precautions, and the cavity
thoroughly irrigated with a mild carbolic acd or boric acid solution. A
sterile emulsion is prepared of ten parts of iodoform to ninety parts of
olive oil. From one to five drams of the emulsion, according to the size of the
cavity, are injected and retained. This is repeated every two to five days.
In cases where healing fails to occur after a reasonable time it often becomes
necessary to reopen the cavity, thoroughly cleanse it, remove all diseased
material and perhaps pack it with iodoform gauze for a short time or continue
the injections as seems indicated.

It is claimed that the local cutaneous manifestations of leprosy disappear
quite readily when injections are made of a twenty per cent solution of iodoform in olive oil. In tubercular infiltrations and other deposits where pus
has not formed, a small quantity of the emulsion is injected. It prevents the
development of bacilli, assists in the removal of the retrograde waste and
promotes the essential healing processes. The use of the emulsion in cold
abscesses, especially those having numerous fistulous openings, will yield satisfactory results.

It is also advisable in the treatment of gonorrhea or gleet incorporated
in a soluble bougie and introduced into the urethra. A very small quantity
of the iodoform is sufficient in each bougie. Five grains is altogether too
much and may prove irritating; from one-half to one grain is sufficient.

The objectionable odor of iodoform is difficult to mask. The balsam of
Peru, freshly ground coffee, aromatic oils, especially the oils of citronella
or thyme or eucalyptol may be used. Iodoform has been given internally
as an active alterative, and as a stomach tonic and intestinal antiseptic. It
ig given in pill form usually combined with other stomachic tonics.

ARISTOL.

Synonyms—Thymoliodide, Annidalin.

Therapy—lIn its therapeutic properties the agent is the analogue of
iodoform, performing its good offices without odor and without danger. It
may be used in exactly the same conditions as iodoform. With lanolin it
makes an excellent ointment. It is suggested that it increases the discharge
of serum from wounds and is best used in dry sores and skin disorders and
in wounds where there is not much moisture. It has been used dusted into
the eye in interstitial keratitis with good results.

GERMICIDES AND ANTISEPTICS 489
ACIDUM BORICUM.

Synonyms—Boric Acid, Acidum Boracicum, Boracic Acid.

Physiological Action—In excessive doses it depresses the spinal centers
and has produced depression of the heart, with slow, feeble pulse, reaction
of temperature and disturbed respiration, nausea, vomiting, hiccough, great
mental depression, impaired mental action, dullness and ultimately coma.
There are cutaneous irritation and eruption with ecchymosis and edema. It
is eliminated through all the emunctories.

As an antiseptic application, the agent is not poisonous, enough will
hardly be applied to produce serious results.

Its germ destroying properties are not considered great, and yet its influence is of such a character that it has come into general use as a dressing
powder for wounds, and its cleanly, odorless, non-toxic and non-irritating
character gives it great popularity as a dry dressing after surgical operations of whatever character.

Therapy—As a mouth wash in cases of ulceration, in aphthous or gangrenous stomatitis, it is useful and acceptable to the patient. It has been
successfully used in diphtheria, both as a gargle, and for its constitutional
influences.

To a saturated solution of boric acid, a few grains of thymol or eucalyptol ean be added and a most serviceable antiseptic for general external or
internal use may be improvised. Its odor and taste can both be made very
pleasant as a mouth or throat wash, or as a spray in the nasal cavity. It may
be so combined as to answer an excellent purpose as an intestinal antiseptic
where such an agent is needed. Boric acid is freely applied to erysipelas
with excellent results, it is applicable in the form of a wet dressing on gauze
and is quickly soothing and healing.

In saturated solution it forms a serviceable wet dressing for infected
wounds whilst evaporation is prevented by the application of oiled silk or
rubber protective. It may be left on for twenty-four or forty-eight hours if
necessary and the virulence of the infection with the inflammation quickly
abates. Applied to boils or carbuncles, the same wet dressing is more effective
than poultices.

It is excellent in its application to open abscesses that have been thoroughly cleansed from pus and put into an aseptic condition, the dry acid here
freely powdered on the granulating surfaces quickly promotes the healing.

Bromidrosis of the feet or of the axilla or other local forms, is successfully treated with this solution. Bromidrosis unversalis will yield to its use
promptly, but thoroughly alterative treatment is needed in these cases.

In cystitis, its solution is used freely as an irrigating fluid, especially if
the urine is ammoniacal, and it is acknowledged to be of much value and
perfectly safe. It has a soothing and healing influencé upon mucous surfaces which is most kindly. In cases of this nature it is also given internally
in doses of from six to ten grains every three hours. It is applied freely to
atid of the womb after thorough cleansing, and it quickly promotes
healing.

A solution of boric acid to which a small quantity of morphine is added,
sometimes is very prompt in its action on various forms of pruritus wherever
existing.

It forms an excellent wash in the common forms of inflammation of the
eyes and may be used freely and safely, as it is non-irritating. It is especially valuable in ophthalmia neonatorum. It is used in conjunctivitis and in
granular lids. A solution of five grains to the ounce is of sufficient strength
for the eyes.

Rister’s ointment, very useful for rough and abraded skin, sunburn, tan
and freckles, for chapped hands and minor burns, is made by combining a
dram each of boric acid and white wax with two drams each of lanolin and
oil of sweet almonds.

CREASOTUM.

Synonym—Creasote.

Physiological Action—In its physiological action it closely resembles
carbolic acid. It is powerfully antiseptic, and is eliminated through the
lungs and bronchial mucous membrane as well as through the kidneys. This
fact renders it of service as a stimulant to bronchial secretion and a sedative
to bronchial irritation. It thoroughly disinfects the lung structure and destroys germs there, and allays irritability of the gastric mucous membrane
as well.

Therapy—The agent has come into general use in the treatment of
phthisis. A purified form is used, and administered in a variety of ways.
It is taken in doses varying from one to three drops combined with wine,
glycerine, syrup of acacia, and other syrups of various characters, and in pill
form. It diminishes cough, expectoration, fever, night sweats and diarrhea,
has a soothing action on the stomach, checks fermentation, allays irritation
and controls vomiting. It promotes the absorption of food and encourages
nutrition. It is truly a valuable adjunct to the treatment and has stopped
the progress of the disease in its incipiency.

In purulent pneumonitis with formed cavities, it is a superior agent.
The combination of beef peptinoids and creasote is a palatable and nutritious
combination in this stage of the disease. Its antiseptic and stimulating influences are apparent from the first. In chronic bronchitis and bronchorrhea
it has a specific influence in correcting offensive expectoration.

Valentine gave creasote in a number of cases of diabetes mellitus. He
began with the daily dose of four drops and increased it to ten. The sugar
disappeared and did not return with a starch or saccharine diet. It has also
been used in Bright’s disease and in some cases its influence was believed to
be beneficial. It is contra-indicated in large doses as the kidneys will become
irritated by it.

RESORCINOL.

Synonym—Resorcinol U. S. P. Metadioxybenzol.

Physiological Action—Resorcinol is closely allied to carbolic acid and
is used in many of the conditions in which the latter is indicated. In full
doses it produces extreme perspiration, salivation, vertigo, fullness in the head
and deafness, unconsciousness and convulsions. It has an antipyretic influence, quite marked, but too depressing.

Therapy—It is specifically an intestinal antiseptic. For this purpose it
us used in catarrhal gastritis with gastric ulcers, with much satisfaction.
The dose is from one to four grains in capsules, or pill form before eating.
Its use has been persisted in through the course of typhoid fever and in
typhoid conditions accompanying pneumonia and other inflammatory fevers,
also in fetid bronchorrhea, and during the stage of pus formation in inflammatory fevers, and in cholera infantum. It has been used to good advantage
in whooping-cough, and should be of much service in diphtheria.

Externally it is used as other stimulating antiseptics in ulcers and abscesses, to irrigate pus cavities, in otorrhoea, gonorrhea, leucorrhea, gan-

GERMICIDES AND ANTISEPTICS 491

grene, boils, carbuncles, chilblains and frost bites. In skin diseases, it is used
i eipelas, eczema, psoriasis, herpes, chancres, and in myoma and epioma,

PHENOL. ACIDUM CARBOLICUM.

Synonyms—Carbolic acid, B. P., phenol, U. S. P., phenic acid, phenylic
acid, phenylie alcohol.

Physiological Action—Phenol is deadly in its action on the lower forms
of vegetable and animal life, destroying disease germs and opposing putrefaction and fermentation. It prevents saccharine fermentation but does not
interfere with the conversion of starch into sugar.

Taken into the mouth or applied to the skin, it produces burning and irritation, followed by numbness, having marked local anesthetic properties. If
its application be prolonged, it destroys tissue and may produce sloughing.
This, or gangrene may be the result if it be painted around a finger or toe,
or if a small area be included in its application. It occludes the capillary
circulation by its constringent influence, and local death results.

It is readily absorbed, even through the skin, and poisoning is common
through absorption from a broken surface or open wound. Taken internally,
it induces diminution, or suppression of urine, with pallor, nausea, vomiting,
nervous trembling, contracted pupils, abnormal nerve sensations and suspended reflexes. There are often great nervous shock, coldness of the skin,
feeble, shallow breathing, collapse and sudden death from paralysis of the
respiration. The evidences of its having been taken by mouth are the white
patches of the mucous membrane of the lips—tongue and mouth covered with
white skin from its rapidly destructive influence.

Phenol is astringent and stimulant in its local applications. It stimulates
and promotes granulation in indolent ulcers, coagulates albumen and to an
extent controls passive local hemorrhages.

Antidotes—When poisoning has occurred from its ingestion, the most
speedy and accessible chemical antidote for immediate administration is dilute vinegar, or acetic acid. The vinegar should be diluted so that it will not
induce strangulation, and a large quantity should be drunk freely at once.

Alkalies are in common use, such as solution of common soap or sulphate
of magnesium or calcium. If the syrup of lime or lime water is at hand, either
is indicated. The whites of eggs are a domestic remedy. The stomach
should be washed out after the administration of the neutralizing agents,
and if the patient survives, the magnesium or calcium sulphate should be
continued several days to neutralize and antagonize the acid in the system.
Cream drunk freely of great benefit.

A negro who had taken a strong solution of phenol instead of whiskey
was given a dram of the tincture of iodine in one dose, diluted with water.
The results were highly satisfactory. Some children drank a phenol solution and to them was given the iodine solution, with water with the same
results. The iodine with phenol produces an insoluble iodophenate.

Therapy—The agent is a great favorite in private practice in all surgical operations and for the complete disinfection of instruments. In hospital practice the bichloride of mercury has been until recently commonly
used in preference, although more dangerous and absolutely inapplicable to
instruments.

The application of a weak solution of carbolic acid is authorized in all
forms of wounds or sores or open surfaces, and as a parasiticide to tinea in
its various forms. It is also used in many varieties of skin disease and in

small-pox to prevent the itching and pitting. In anticipation of the latter
disease it is used internally as a prophylactic.

Its application in full strength is indicated in carbuncle, a single application sometimes destroying the malignancy. In cases of this disease and in
malignant pustule it not only destroys the germ of the disease, and thus the
malignancy, but it relieves the pain by its anesthetic influence. It has been
employed to retard the growth, to destroy the odor, and to relieve the pain
of cancers.

In fermentative dyspepsia with bad breath and a bad taste in the mouth,
carbolic acid internally in doses of from one-sixth to one-half of a grain,
im syrup or emulsion or in pill form, serves a good purpose. It is useful in
dilated stomach and is excellent in some cases of obstinate vomiting. As a
general intestinal antiseptic it is rather too poisonous and too difficult of
administration for common use, and it can be readily displaced by other nontoxic and not unpleasant remedies, having been used in all diseases where
profound antisepsis was necessary. It has been volatilized and inhaled in
diphtheria, croup, bronchitis or pneumonitis with purulent discharge, and in
whooping-cough.

A drop applied on cotton will allay the pain of an aching tooth.

This agent is of material benefit in the injection of piles. These tumors
have been treated by this measure for two or more decades. When carefully adjusted, the treatment is usually satisfactory. The agent was recommended by Bacelli of Italy some years ago as an injection to destroy the
tetanic bacillus. The dosage he advised was large and few accepted his suggestions. More recently, in the United States, especially among our own
physicians, the agent has been frequently used in conjunction with glycerine
and an active antispasmodic in tetanus, with curative results. One reliable
authority cured twelve successive cases by a sixty minim injection of equal
parts of phenol, gelsemium, and glycerine. Others report favorably.

A paste made of linseed oil seven parts, phenol one part, and sufficient
whiting (calcium carbonate), has been used by our physicians for many years.
Advised by Dr. Whitford, and by Dr. Bennet of Halifax in the treatment
of carbuncles, abscesses, sloughing wounds, and seriously infected open
sores, many have reported this superior to better known applications.

Ten drops of phenol and one dram of epsom salts in four ounces of
water makes an excellent application over local inflammations where there
is pain and redness.

GUAIACOL.

Synonym—Methyl Pyrocatechin.

Therapy—It is preferable in the treatment of phthisis to creasote, acting in the same manner, but more promptly and satisfactorily. It is given
in wines or glycerine or in pearls or capsules. Its vapor is added to hot
water and inhaled in chronic bronchial and lung troubles.

It is useful also in tubercular conditions of the skin and joints and in
lupus. Antipyretic properties are attributed to carbolic acid and creasote,
but this agent possesses them to a marked degree. If applied to the skin
in fevers, it slowly reduces the temperature. This has taken place suddenly
but usually without great depression or prostration. The great disadvantage
is that after a reduction so induced, the patient is apt to have a chill and
the temperature then rises as high or higher than before. Stolzenberg says
there is great sweating and profound prostration after its use. It is unreliable and in fact, dangerous, when used for this purpose.

## Page 488

GERMICIDES AND ANTISEPTICS 493

‘It has also been given in gastric ulcer and in typhus and typhoid fever
and in cholera with good results. It does not undergo decomposition in the
intestinal canal nor in the blood, as its odor can be detected in that fluid and
in all the fluids and tissues of the body after it has been taken for some
time.

For its external influences it can be applied where ecarbolic acid is indicated, but for many reasons the latter drug is often preferable. It will replace carbolic acid to advantage where there are inflamed serous or mucous
surfaces or glandular structures with foul ulcers or gangrene. In purulent
otorrhea, malignant sore throat or gonorrheal discharges, leucorrhea or
chronic metritis, it is useful.

GUAIACOL CARBONATE.

Synonym—Carbonate of Guaiacol.

Therapy—This agent has been brought into prominence by the theory
that in certain complex combinations it may be made the active agent in
the abnormal of typhoid fever. There has been a great discussion of its
action in recent periodical medical literature; but we find that the best
results are no better, if as good as those obtained from our own usual methods, and have the enormous disadvantage of inducing greatly increased irritation by combination with intestinal irritants. Used alone or in non-irritating combinations, the agent will prove to be a valuable intestinal antiseptic; but like all agents that depend upon decomposition in the intestinal
canal to release its active constituents, it must be more or less unreliable.

It is used in fermentative diarrhoeas and other intestinal conditions depending upon decomposition, but we much prefer to depend upon our safe
vegetable intestinal antiseptics and depurants to produce the desired results.

This agent is now being extensively experimented with intravenously in
the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. So far, very encouraging results
are reported. It is proving beneficial in these in conjunction with salicylic
acid in large doses of concentrated solutions in chronic rheumatism; in tubercular adenitis and other local tubercular conditions, and in some forms of
goiter. In a tabulated statement of observations made of a writer in The
New York Medical Journal in 1914, this combination made by far the best
showing in pulmonary tuberculosis.

THYMOL.

Synonyme—Acidum thymicum, thymic acid.

Therapy—This substance is a pleasant, stimulating antiseptic, and, when
too freely used, is an irritant of much power, but rather expensive for general surgical use. Flies are drawn to it by its odor, which is also an objection. It is also a local anesthetic to both the mucous membranes and the skin,
and is quite permanent in its effects.

It is used in all the conditions named for carbolic acid and the other
phenols. It is especially desirable in that it adds to the pleasantness of the
odor and taste of antiseptic douches, washes and gargles.

It is applicable to putrid and gangrenous sores and as a stimulating
antiseptic gargle in diphtheria.

It is the active constituent of a popular remedy for chronic nasal catarrh,
which was advised ten years ago by an English physician, and afterwards
much praised in this country. In combination with menthol, it is constantly
used by rhinologists and laryngologists in the form of spray.

The internal use of thymol will destroy the filaria sanguinis hominis, the
cause of chyluria, and is thus curative in that disease. This is especially true
if it be given in conjunction or in alternation with gallic acid.

Sandwith (Lancet) claims that thymol is a most perfect destroyer of the
ankylostomum duodenale and many accompanying parasites in the intestines. Sometimes it takes many doses of the drug to destroy the last remaining nematode. In extreme cases two doses of 30 grains each are given on an
empty stomach, and in two hours a purge is given. Subsequent smaller
doses may be given on two or three occasions. The treatment is usually
effectual.

POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE.

Formula—K™Mn0,,.

Therapy—This agent is a powerful antiseptic, this property being exercised by virtue of its innate ability to readily release its oxygen. A solution of this salt in the strength of from ten to twenty grains to the pint of
pure water is of excellent service in cleansing pus forming surfaces. It is
valuable as an irrigating fluid in cleansing pulmonary abscess and in washing out the pleural sac after the evacuation of pus. Its influence is similar
in all such cases to that of the peroxide of hydrogen, but it is more efficacious,
although not usually as manageable.

In extreme cases of cystitis, this solution may be used as an irrigating
fluid, but it is advisable to immediately follow the use of the solution with
a douche of sterilized water.

The solution is applicable to unhealthy granulating surfaces, to cold abcesses and to slowly healing open wounds, especially if purulent in character.
In all such cases and in any condition where there is foul odor, its deodorizing properties serve an excellent purpose. In malignant diphtheria and
putrid ulceration of the throat or mouth, it is useful, also where the gums
are spongy, and decaying teeth produce a disagreeable odor. It forms an
excellent wash in chronic catarrh with an unpleasant odor, and in otitis
media.

It is applicable to felons, slowly healing boils and carbuncles, and open
cancerous surfaces may be freely irrigated with a warm solution of the permanganate three or four times daily. It destroys the odor of cancer and delays the rapidity of its development. The solution is useful in the treatment
of cancer of the os uteri. It is of much value in simple ulcerations of the
cervix and in offensive forms of leucorrhea. The application of the solution
on cotton or other dressings is useless, as it is decomposed before it reaches
the diseased surface.

Applied immediately to poisoned wounds, by its oxydizing power, it at
once destroys the venom. If it be applied into the open wound and the solution be injected hypodermically into the tissues immediately around the
wound, poisonous results may be averted. Its antidoting power in these
cases is chemical, not physiological, consequently it is valueless if free absorption has taken place.

Administered in full doses after the taking of any organic poison—the
alkaloids and organic acids, and phosphorus into the stomach—these are rendered innocuous.

In doses of one grain in pill form carefully prepared, it has been given
with success in the treatment of amenorrhea of an atonic character, usually
administered after meals. It is undoubtedly successful in many stubborn
cases, but it is questionable if it is as useful as the manganese dioxide, which
is not so readily decomposed. If it were not for the facility with which it

parts with its oxygen in the fluids of the stomach, it would be of much
oT. as an intestinal antiseptic, and valuable as an oxygen carrier to the
lood.

AQUA HXDROGENI DIOXIDI.

Synonyms—Solution of Hydrogen Dioxide, Solution of Hydrogen Peroxide—Oxygenated Water, Peroxide of Hydrogen.

Physiological Action—This agent is a powerful oxidizant, especially
when brought in contact with organic substances. It destroys disease germs
rapidly, and when brought in contact with ulcerating surfaces, it causes albuminous coagulation, and forms a white coating, evolving gas rapidly.

Because of its oxidizing properties, it is an active deodorant, destroying
all products of decomposition or fermentation. Brought into contact with
pus, the oxygen gas is liberated rapidly, the character of the substance is destroyed, and the diseased area is converted into a normal granulating surface. Its influence is similar to that of the permanganate of potassium. The
objection to its use within closed cavities is the free formation of gas, and
distension from this formation. There can be no objection, provided there
be a sufficient opening to allow the free escape of gas, and subsequent
irrigation.

Therapy—The agent is desirable under proper circumstances in washing
‘out pus cavities anywhere in the lungs, but the application of this substance
must be followed by irrigation with sterilized water. In the treatment of
diseases of the nose and throat, where the excessive catarrhal discharge is
present, a wash of this substance is of much value. In the ulcerative forms,
a spray, applied in the nostrils and throat morning and evening, of one part
of hydrozone to eight or ten parts of warm water, will be found serviceable.
In the treatment of hay fever much benefit is experienced from the application of solutions of hydrozone of one-half the strength of the above, or the
peroxide of hydrogen, one part in ten of water, will be beneficial.

In the treatment of croup and diphtheria we have few remedies of
greater service than this. In diphtheria, where the membrane has formed
rapidly upon the tonsils, or upon the throat, where the direct application of
the peroxide is possible, the entire membrane may be removed at one sitting.
The course adopted by the writer before our present improved methods were
known was to fasten the patient’s mouth open with a properly adjusted gag,
then covering his own face with a towel, saturated with a mild carbolie acid
solution, the eyes only exposed, he seated himself in front of the patient
and applied the sixteen volume peroxide with a camel’s hair brush, removing the exudate as rapidly as it is loosened, allowing the patient occasionally
to wash the mouth and throat with warm sterilized water, or a mild carbolic
acid solution. It was not always possible to persist in the single application
sufficiently long to produce this entire result. Under these circumstances it
was advisable to give the patient persistently a diluted solution internally,
and to use the same preparation as a gargle every one or two hours, according to the severity of the case. In infants, local applications are often impracticable.

In laryngeal diphtheria or membranous croup, it is almost impossible to
apply the solution to the membrane with sufficient persistency to entirely destroy it. One of our physicians, however, in despair, after having performed
the operation of tracheotomy upon his own child, passed a long-handled
camel’s hair brush through the incision, and persisted in the application of
this remedy to the membrane, within the trachea above the incision until the
membrane was entirely removed, and the patient’s life was saved.

Inhalations of the spray of hydrozone have been used in the treatment
of bronchitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, whooping-cough, consumption, and
other lung and throat disorders with varying success.

Formerly the agent was more generally used in the treatment of wounds,
pus forming surfaces, and upon sores. Failures may be due to too great dependence upon this agent alone. It is desirable to cleanse the surface thoroughly with this agent, especially if there be a tendency to the formation of
pus, and to then use some other application, either dry, moist, or in the form
of an ointment, as seems best indicated. It is occasionally an irritant, inducing a condition that must be subsequently overcome. This may be due to
the presence of an excess of the free acid, which it usually contains for purposes of preservation.

Internally from the one-fourth to the one-half of a teaspoonful of the
hydrogen peroxide, diluted with one-half glass of water, may be given before meals, when there is an old standing catarrhal gastritis, with ulceration.
It certainly promotes free secretion of acid, stimulates the digestion, allays
pain and causes the healing of ulcerated conditions.

It is argued that the agent suffer decomposition before it reaches the intestinal canal. It certainly prevents fermentation, destroys disease germs
within the intestinal canal, overcomes bad breath, and prevents the formation
or accumulation of intestinal gases. Upon giving a few drops of the solution
in the drinking water, to a patient suffering from typhoid fever, its influence
is quickly observed, and if an occasional flushing of the lower bowel with
hot water which contains ten per cent of this substance be practiced, a more speedy cure will certainly result. It is the writer’s practice
to give this preparation freely in all diseases of children where there is a
tendency to fetid diarrhea, bad breath, or tympanites.

It has recently been observed that the agent has an immediately destructive influence upon the bacillus of tetanus. In the treatment of that
disease the infected wound has been thoroughly washed with hydrogen peroxide with marked benefit.

Externally the agent is used in the treatment of eczema, psoriasis, lupus,
sycosis, erysipelas and in the poisoning from rhus toxicodendron, and the
bites of insects. It is also used for the removal of acne, freckles, moth
patches, dandruff, and for the cure of chapped hands.

FORMALDEHYDE.

Formula— (CHO) H.

Synonyms—Methylaldehyde, Formicaldehyde, Oxymethylene.

Description—A forty per cent solution of Formaldehyde forms the substance commercially known as formalin or formal—Formaldehyde as used in
medicine. It is a light-green, mobile, exceedingly volatile liquid, pungent,
ee with a slightly acid reaction from the presence of acetic and formic
acids.

Physiological Action—This substance, whether produced in the atmosphere directly, or given off as a vapor from its solutions in concentrated form,
is an irritant to the entire respiratory tract, and to the eyes. It is a most
active antiseptic or disinfectant and deodorant. Internally its influence has
not been widely observed as yet, beyond that it is a profound gastro-intestinal antiseptic, preventing fermentation, especially that of butyric and
lactic acids. Lamps have been devised for the combustion of methylic aleohol
in an incomplete manner, setting free formaldehyde in the air for the disinfection of rooms, instruments, or whatever is essential for surgical, hygienic

or sanitary purposes. Extravagant claims are made that it destroys the
bacteria of tuberculosis, typhoid, diphtheria, etc., and other germs, even in
dilute forms of the agent. Further experiments prove that the penetrating
power of the vapor is not great, and that it is not actively destructive to
animal life, even in the lowest forms, although the vapor in a room will drive
out flies, mosquitoes, moths and gnats.

Therapy—tThe agent is used largely at present for disinfecting purposes.
The solution in vessels in the sick chamber prevents the spread of infection,
if sprinkled over the bedding and furniture in the room. In all infectious
and contagious disorders it will be found of service. It may be applied to
instruments freely, and surfaces to be operated upon are bathed with it.

In the treatment of diphtheria, membranous croup, the sore throat of
scarlet fever, and the bronchial cough of measles, it has been used. The
vapor of formaldehyde inhaled will be found of much service in whooping
cough, the number of paroxysms of which, are lessened by it, and their
severity greatly modified. It has been used with satisfactory results in the
developing stages of phthisis pulmonalis, and in tubercular disease of the
joints and the skin, especially those of an-open or ulcerative character.

Open wounds and infected sores are washed with it, and it is used for
vaginal and uterine irrigation, and for the irrigation and disinfection of
abscess cavities. If dressings wet with the solution be kept in contact with
carcinomatous and other malignant growths, with open, foul-smelling surfaces, the odor is destroyed, pain is allayed, and the development is retarded.
In the treatment of gonorrhea, especially that of the female, it is most satisfactory in its action. A five per cent solution thoroughly applied into the
folds of the vagina with a cotton swab will destroy the infection and promote rapid healing.

SULPHUR.

Symbol—S.

Physiological Action—Sulphur is an antiseptic, an active parasiticide,
and internally it is laxative. It was supposed at one time to possess an alterative influence and was administered as a blood purifier. It acts by chemical
change and such action is apt to be unreliable in the system. In full quantities it is slowly decomposed, and the odor of the sulphide will appear upon
the breath. It is absorbed, as it appears in all of the excretions, and jewelry
worn during its administration will become tarnished, its volatility conducing to this fact. Used for a protracted period it will impair the condition
of the blood, causing anemia and inducing muscular weakness. Its protracted use also induces eruptions and eczematous conditions of the skin.

It is a mild laxative, softening the feces and rendering them easy of expulsion.

Therapy—Sulphur was at one time used in the treatment of diphtheria
for the destruction of the virulence of the bacilli. A combination of sulphur
one dram, sulphurous acid two drams, syrup and glycerine, of each one
ounce, can be given, a teaspoonful every two hours. The consistency of this
compound retains it in contact with the throat, and this contact destroys
the germs, the exudate being readily thrown off. This combination, alternated every hour with from five to ten drops of the tincture of the chloride
of iron, was among the first successful methods adopted for the cure of
diphtheria.

Sulphur is in common use among homeopathic physicians, and is considered a most reliable agent in a wide range of conditions. It is ‘specific with

them in scrofulous or specific indurations of the lymphatic glands, or catarrhal conditions of the mucous linings, from similar causes, with ulcerations or thick, fetid mucous discharges.

Sulphur is used as a domestic remedy in some localities, as a gargle for
all forms of sore throat and sore mouth, especially in tonsillitis and in
pharyngitis. It is of no benefit to inflamed structures without exudate. It

as been used in stomach disorders and is of service in the dyspepsia of
scrofulous patients, with bad breath, bad taste in the mouth, and a sensation
of fullness in the stomach after eating. As a laxative it is useful in cases
where there is deficient intestinal secretion, the feces being persistently hard
and impacted, or scybala being present. It is of much service in rectal ulcers,
and in anal fissures, and in hemorrhoids. Tablets of cream of tartar and sulphur have long been in common use for the cure of habitual constipation, and
for inactivity of the liver, with deficiency of the biliary secretions.

Sulphur for many years has been the sovereign remedy for itch. Sulphur and lard externally, and sulphur and molasses internally are among the
memories of the remote past, in the mind of many an old physician. The
agent has lost none of its virtues in the treatment of scabies. It surely destroys the acarus scabiei, if the patient has a thorough bath with vigorous
rubbing before the application of the sulphur ointment. The rubbing removes the dead cuticle over the burrows in which the female hides to deposit
her eggs, and immediate contact with sulphur destroys the parasite. The
male does not burrow.

In many forms of skin disease sulphur is curative. Alternated with
potassium nitrate in the following manner, it is the surest treatment for intractable cases of acne, in young women with disordered menses, and irritable nervous system, that the writer has ever used. A teaspoonful of precipitated sulphur and as much powdered nitrate of potassium are each stirred
into a quart of water, in separate vessels. Twice daily the face is washed in
sulphur or tar soap to thoroughly cleanse it; it is then washed with clean
hot water and rubbed with a soft cloth and dried. The sulphur lotion is
thoroughly applied in the morning, and the nitrate of potassium lotion in the
evening after the preliminary cleansing, or vice versa. The lotions are not
wiped off but allowed to evaporate. This method has completely cured
cases for the writer where the extreme disfiguration had almost deranged the
mind of the patient, after resisting all treatments for years. Sulphur ointments, however, are not satisfactory in acne. The fat of the ointment base
clogs the ducts of the glands and aggravates the condition. Sulphur is
curative to eczema, if the condition is caused by the presence of a parasite,
otherwise it is an irritant and must be avoided. It is used also in comedo,
in ecthyma, in sycosis, in psoriasis and in impetigo.

In sciatica and in some other chronic, painful, local, neuralgic, rheumatic or gouty conditions, sulphur has been used to envelop the painful
part. Local perspiration results, there is absorption of the agent and permanent relief often occurs in a short time.

In some cases of urinary disorder sulphur is used where there is decomposition of the urine from chronic catarrh of the bladder with incontinence and frequent urination.

It is advised in conditions of general blood impairment with paralysis,
but must be given in conjunction with nerve stimulants and tonics.

ACIDUM SULPHUROSUM.
Formula—H,SO,.

Synonym—Sulphurous Acid.

Physiological Action—This agent is an antiseptic and germicide of
much power. It arrests fermentation by destroying the ferments. It is also
a deoxidizing and decolorizing agent.

Specific Symptomatology—The indications for sulphurous acid in low
fevers are feebleness and prostration, a red, sleek, or narrow, dry and pointed
tongue, showing extreme lack of tone in the stomach.

Therapy—The agent has been used with much success in the treatment
of sporadic disease. Given internally, it destroys the germ of diphtheria and
is destructive in tubercular bacilli. It may also be taken internally in the
treatment than this for early cases of uncomplicated diphtheria, where there
fifteen drops of the dilute acid may be given in syrup.

The author considers this a most important remedy in the treatment of

- any acute disease of the throat or pharynx, accompanied with an exudate,
whether it be specific or non-specific. The dilute acid may be given in some
form of simple syrup, or as named above in the therapy of sulphur. It is especially advantageous if the mucous membranes are dark colored or dry and
dusky, with high temperature, or if the tongue is coated a brown coat, dry
and pointed, with red edges, or if the tongue is of a smooth, red color, or has
a violet tinge. But in any case, the exudate will be removed by the use of
this remedy, certainly as quickly as with any other known agent.

A very palatable combination that may be administered to children
when no application can be made to the throat consists of three drams of dilute sulphurous acid, one dram of the flowers of sulphur, in two ounces, of
the syrup of tolu, or the mucilage of acacia. If a diphtheritic exudate is extensive and there is obstructed breathing, with difficulty in swallowing, half
of a teaspoonful may be given every half hour or a teaspoonful, even, at each
dose, and no water allowed afterward, as the local influence of the agent is
desirable.

The most sanguine prescriber is apt to be surprised at the promptness
with which this simple formula will often cause all of the exudate to disappear, and will materially assist in destroying the toxines. Combined for
their specific indications with aconite and phytolacca, we need no better
treatment than this for early cases of uncomplicated diphtheria, where there
is only small patches of exudate before paralysis or heart failure occur.
The author has observed results occurring as quickly from this as from antitoxin.

It will serve an excellent purpose in pneumonia, where there is expectoration of purulent matter and in bronchitis, where there is an excessive
fetid discharge.

In dyspepsia with fermentation where there is vomiting of a material
resembling yeast; in intestinal dyspepsia with the development of much gas
and fetid fecal discharges, this acid serves an excellent purpose, especially
in those cases where there is a deficiency of acids in the system as evidenced
by dark-colored mucous membranes and deficiency of secretions.

Sulphurous acid externally applied will cure parasitic skin disease even
more promptly than sulphur. It will destroy the acarus scabiei and is useful
in psora, trichosis, parasitic diseases of the scalp, and

It has been applied with excellent effect to ill- conditioned ulcers and to
gangrene.

The application of this acid is made with good effect to sore nipples.
Kept constantly applied for a short time it destroys the cause of the ulceration, and simple ointments or other applications will then complete the cure.

Diluted with glycerine it has been applied to erysipelas, quickly relieving the
burning and preventing the further spread of the disease.

Sulphurous acid applied to bruises, chapped hands and chilblains is
speedily curative. Half of a dram of this acid in an ounce of equal parts
of glycerine and rose water, is a pleasant and speedy cure for chapped conditions of the hands, face or lips.

SULPHUROUS ACID GAS. SULPHUR DIOXIDE.

For disinfecting purposes in contagious and infectious diseases the burning of sulphur is in genéral use for fumigation. The product of the burning of this substance is the dioxide of sulphur, which is a dense, colorless
gas twice as heavy as air, with a pungent, suffocating odor. Its influence
upon lower animal life and disease germs is exceedingly destructive.

In the process of the fumigation of infected apartments, all furniture,
pictures and articles of a character or color which will be injured by the
acid vapor must be removed. The apartment should then be densely charged
with the vapor, which is allowed to remain for from eight to twenty-four
hours. The room is then opened and thoroughly ventilated.

A German authority a few years ago advised this method of purifying
the atmosphere of a room in which a patient suffering from whooping cough
slept. The influence of the vapor on the atmosphere was accredited with the
cure of many cases of this subborn malady, sometimes in a single night. The
nightclothes of the patient with the bedclothes, were subject to the fumigation, and the air of the room thoroughly renovated before the patient retired. The writer has much confidence in this method of treatment for
whooping cough.

Ringer advises immersing the body in a bath of this gas for half an
hour, the head being free, where there is an extensive parasitic disease. If
the clothes are so treated the disease is permanently cured by the complete
destruction of the germ. 5

We have succeeded in a short time by the application of the dilute sulphurous or sulphuric acid, applying the latter acid sufficiently strong to produce an intense smarting, washing it off when it is no longer bearable. A
single application will destroy the acarus scabiei.

CUPRIC ARSENITE.

Synonym—Arsenite of copper..

Specific Symptomatology—Its specific indications are diarrhea, with
frequent voluminous watery discharges. With this there is often violent
vomiting of a large quantity of watery substance, and sharp, cutting colicky
pains. The stools are tinged with green and are usually of a stinking, nasty
odor. In several years’ use of the remedy, we have never failed once with
above indications. The author makes no attempt to explain the action of the
remedy...

Thera y—It is thus indicated in diarrhea of childhood, especially in
cholera, infeotum; it is certainly a sovereign remedy when watery, greenishcolored, fetid diarrhea is present....

Hale says in cholera infantum with spasmodic pains, with screams and
cramps in the fingers and toes, it is a most reliable intestinal antiseptic, and
the change in the odor of the discharges is quickly perceptible. An impression is often made upon the entire character of the disease in a few hours.

This reaction on the part of the general system from the prostrating influence of the disease seems unusually prompt after using this remedy.

The agent is also recommended in chorea and in the irregular and intermittent heart accompanying such a condition. Anomalous disorders of the
heart are specified as indicated by a heart that beats at one time irregular
and very feeble, and at another time irregular, but very violent with no altered heart sounds. We have organic remedies, however, for these conditions whose action is more thoroughly understood. C

It is a most excellent remedy in typhoid fever with the characteristic
diarrhea. Its active intestinal antiseptic influence is marked and other influences obtain that are very desirable. Alternated with the indicated fever
remedy in the early stages of the disease, the condition is often greatly
abridged.

Arsenite of Copper is often overlooked as a diuretic. It is indicated
when deficient secretion of urine or suppression are due to cold, or when the
activity of the skin is lessened by an extensive burn; where an extra amount
of work is thrown upon the kidneys, increasing local hyperemia. A doctor
reports a case where complete suppression of the urine occurred from a cold
shower bath after violent exercise. He wrapped the patient in hot blankets,
inducing perspiration with hot water bottles, gave him a laxative. Five oneone-hundredth grain tablets of arsenite of copper were given and repeated
in two hours. He then gave one tablet every hour. The promptness with
which this agent started the secretion of urine surprised him greatly, as the
entire normal quantity was almost restored within twenty-four hours, with
a complete abatement of the early symptoms of uremia.

Dr. Wallace advises this remedy for inactivity of the kidneys—deficient
renal action. He has used it many years.

BISMUTH SALIOYLATE.

Synonym—Salicylate of bismuth.

Occurrence—This salt is formed by the action of the nitrate of bismuth
in solution in glycerine, upon the sodium salicylate.

Description—It occurs as a soft, white powder, soluble in acids, but in-:
soluble in water, alcohol, glycerine and ether.

Therapy—French and German physicians recommend this agent as a
local antiseptic for external use, and as a most valuable intestinal antiseptic.
It would seem to be indicated internally in much the same conditions as the
subgallate. Wagner claims that it stimulates the action of the heart. If
these facts are true, it should be valuable in the sthenic stage of typhoid
fever and other conditions of this character. It will probably be found of
service in the treatment of tibial ulcers in the forming stage, after having
thoroughly cleansed them with an antiseptic wash.

SANTONICA. ARTEMISIA PAUCIFLORA.

Synonym—Levant wormseed.

ConstITUENTS—Santonin, volatile oil, gum, resin.

PreparaTions—Santonin is a crystalline neutral principle, derived from
Santonica. It occurs in the form of shining, colorless, or slightly yellowish,
flattened, prismatic crystals, odorless, and at first tasteless, but subsequently
bitterish. Nearly soluble in cold water, soluble in 250 parts of boiling water,
and in forty parts of alcohol. Slightly soluble in chloroform and ether.

Trochesci Santonine, Troches of Santonine. Dose, from one to six
troches. Santonin. Dose, from one-fourth to two grains.

Physiological Action—Five grains of santonine given to a child caused
pain in the stomach, convulsions, insensibility and death. Various phenomena
are produced by even smaller doses, as everything appearing yellow or red
throughout the field of vision; urine stained deep yellow; a punctiform rash
or an eruption like that in measles; amaurosis, flushed face, hot head, twitching of the eyeballs, dilatation of the pupils, foaming at the mouth, clenching
of the teeth, jerking of the arms, stertorous breathing. Two grains caused
the death of a feeble child.

Generally, recovery takes place after these symptoms, but occasionally
death follows.

Specific Symptomatology—The following indications, seldom all present
at the same time, point to the presence of lumbricoid worms in the alimentary
canal. They may also be present in part, induced by various other causes of
intestinal irritation. There may be intense itching of the nose in children,
the child rubbing or boring the nostrils, with bloated abdomen, restless sleep,
erying out in affright, grinding of the teeth at night, groaning in sleep, complete loss of appetite, tongue deep red without coating, deficient saliva,
nausea, vomiting, fetid breath, depraved, erratic appetite with longings, great
thirst, aversion to food, abdomen enlarged and hard, diarrhea with whitish,
slimy stools, or bowels constipated followed by looseness, colicky pains in
the bowels, vomiting and purging after meals, worms discharged with the
stools, cramps in the bowels at night, itching at the arms, limbs wasted, face
pale, skin sallow and unhealthy looking, constant urging to urinate, wetting
the bed, urine whitish and cloudy, scalding, dry, hacking, constant cough,
tickling in the larynx and trachea, convulsive movements of the hands and
arms, sensitiveness to the touch over the whole body, twitching of the
muscles, lividity of the face, arrested breath, severe choking sensations, convulsive contraction of the fingers, general convulsions with violent agitation
of the limbs, chorea, haziness of sight, loss of consciousness, restlessness, not
satisfied with anything, will not sleep, fever occurring daily, usually in the
afternoon.

Therapy—The generally accepted influence of santonine is in the line
of its anthelmintic properties. It is an excellent remedy for the long worm
—ascarsis lumbricoides. It is given in doses of from one-half to one grain,
twice or three times daily. In the above symptomatology, however, I have
named a long list of symptoms, which are due to intestinal or gastro-intes-

tinal irritation. In a few cases they may be due to other reflex influences.
Many of these symptoms should be treated with santonin, without regard to
the presence of worms. In fact, if we properly study this remedy, we must
put aside entirely the idea of its anthelmintic properties, and consider it as
& nerve sedative, as an antispasmodic and as a positive and reliable agent
with which to relieve nerve irritations, especially those of a reflex character.

I have made some very conclusive observations in the past fifteen years
that convince me that this remedy is the best remedy we have with which
to relieve reflex irritation, when the cause of the irritation cannot be at once
determined. This is an entirely new field for santonin. I was once treating
a child who suffered from all the symptoms of nerve irritation which are
present with worms. I gave santonin to remove the worms. Santonin relieved the nervous irritation in a most satisfactory manner, but subsequent
observation proved that there were no worms present, but that the irritation was due to faulty digestion and decomposition of food. I was at once
impressed that the agent had relieved the irritation by its influence upon the
nervous system, independent of any action it might have had upon the
worms.

From this observation, I began at once to administer it in all cases where
there was reflex irritation. I was consulted concerning a child seven months
old, who had a persistent hacking cough from its birth, which resisted all
treatment. I allayed the cough in twenty-four hours with half grain doses
of santonin, and the cure was permanent.

I was consulted concerning an irritable heart in an old lady, who was
so enfeebled from the violent and irregular action of the organ that she had
not been able to do anything whatever for over two years. The heart disorder did not seem to be sufficient to cause the extreme weakness, and I
treated it with santonin, as a case of reflex irritation. The results were indeed most surprising. The patient was around the house and assisting with
the work within less than a week.

A physician reported a case to me that was suffering from persistent
protracted fever, with nervous phenomena, that showed it to be of reflex
origin, as all other causes were excluded in the examination. After all known
methods had failed, three doses of santonine, one grain each, reduced the
temperature almost to normal, and that agent alone caused the permanent
abatement of the fever.

I advise with fall assurance of satisfactory results that this remedy be
used freely in the treatment of reflex irritations. I do not think it will be
found necessary to give it in large doses. From one-half a grain to a grain
and a half in an extreme case, will, I think, be sufficient.

I would suggest that it be carefully used in the reflex irritations of pregnancy, especially when there is scanty urine, or when there is deficiency of
renal action, with much local irritation. Also in the beginning stages of the
albuminuria of pregnancy. I am confident that it will do much towards preventing puerperal convulsions if given early. I think there are some cases of
the vomiting of pregnancy that will be quickly allayed by it. I advise that it
be given in hysterical conditions, and in those difficulties where there is irTitation of the ovaries and irritation at the menstrual epoch, especially if
accompanied with some pain.

Lydston advised the use of this remedy in large doses in the treatment of
epilepsy. Its antispasmodic properties would suggest that it be used in cases
where the spasms are due to reflex irritation whether it possesses sufficient
antispasmodic properties to control spasm, as gelsemium, chloral and other
agents of that character do, remains to be proven.

504 MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS

Santonine at times is a positive remedy with which to increase the secretion of urine in children. It gently stimulates the functional action of the
organs, promotes normal secretion and relieves irritation. It is without
doubt, our best remedy with which to restore the secretion in post scarlatinal
or post diphtheritic nephritis. In these cases it may be alternated with positive doses of belladonna. In conjunction with a persistent application of
heat, it will be found useful in post puerperal nephritis, of an acute character,
and probably in other cases, where sudden suppression has resulted from profound sepsis.

Where we find colic with loose, slimy stools, it points to intestinal disorders, while convulsive movements are reflex symptoms, consequent upon the
intestinal disease. These are benefited by this agent.

Santonine influences these conditions by stimulating the great sympathetic and giving tone to the functions of digestion and nutrition.

It has been employed with advantage in nervous failure of sight, nervous
vomiting and nervous diarrhea; but it is doubtful whether it has ever improved the sight in amaurosis or cataract, as has been claimed.

Santonine causes yellow vision and yellow urine. Where worms are
demonstrated to exist in the bowels, it is a common practice to give santonine
with a cathartic of podophyllin, or follow it with castor oil. The agent is
toxic, as stated, and should not be given in material doses for the special purpose of destroying worms, when the child is constipated or suffering from

ever.

SPIGELIA. SPIGELIA MARILANDIOCA.

Synonym—Maryland pink.

ConstITvENTs—Spigeline (bitter principle), fixed oil, volatile oil, resin,
wax, tannin, salts.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Spigelie Fluidum. Fluid Extract of Spigelia.
Dose, from one-half to two drams.

Therapy—Spigelia is specific in the removal of intestinal worms. It need
not be gven in large doses, and if given with proper care is most effectual.
An excellent formula is the following, which contains united action of the two
agents: Fluid extract of spigelia, two drams; santonine pulverized, fifteen
grains; simple elixir, a sufficient quantity to make two ounces. A teaspoonful is given on rising and retiring.

If this agent is followed, on the third day, by an efficient non-irritating
laxative, it seldom fails to remove lumbricoids. The worms are not always
entire when removed, but the evidences of their presence are gone, a slimy or
heavy mucous discharge occurring from the action of the physic.

Spigelia is said to have a mild influence upon the heart. Webster says
it is beneficial in endocarditis, especially in the rheumatic form, and that it
will protect the heart from rheumatic attacks. It is stated that it is beneficial
in angina, in all neuralgic heart affections, and in functional palpitations.
The Spigelia Anthelmintica is thought to be more active in its influence upon
the heart than the Spigelia Marilandica; otherwise there is but little difference in the two species.

CHENOPODIUM. CHENOPODIUM AMBROSIOIDES.
Synonym—American Wormseed.
The oil of the herb and of the seed is the only preparation of chenopodium used. It is a thin, colorless, or slightly yellow liquid having a penetrating camphoraceous odor and a pungent and somewhat bitter taste.

This is strictly an American product, large quantities of the oil being
produced in this country though the foreign demand should establish foreign
sources of supply.

Therapy—This agent has long been used as a remedy for worms but
because of an early objection made to its use on the grounds of certain subtle
dangerous properties, it has not come into general use. In sufficient doses of
from ten to twenty minims of this oil, it was recommended to expel the round
worm. Our own authorities seldom recommended above five minims which
was not always sufficient though safer.

A recent report® puts this agent in its exact place as an anthelmintic. In
the Orient, especially in Singapore and in Sumatra, the oil of chenopodium
is extensively employed against hookworm and other intestinal parasites.
More than 100,000 cases of hookworm of both the Old and New World types
have been treated with practically no untoward effects, and with greater success than with any remedy heretofore employed.

In Sumatra, it is used also with equal confidence, in the treatment of
roundworm, tapeworm, and whipworm. Weiss of Kisaran treated 5,000 cases
of hookworm with highly satsfactory results. There was one case of nephritis
which he thought might have followed it, but the case was quickly controlled.
Schuffner and Baermann in Sumatra have treated over 40,000 cases without
after effects, and with results superior to those obtained from thymol. They
conclude that the efficiency of this remedy over thymol is as 91 to 83.

A ttion—The method of the above observers is to give the
patient a liquid diet for an evening meal, no breakfast on the following morning. From ten to sixteen minims of the oil is placed on sugar divided into
three parts, one part being taken every hour. Two hours after the last dose,
a full dose of castor oil and a full dose of chloroform is given.

Others give ten minims as a single dose in a capsule, giving it every
morning for three days, and on the third day, following it with a tablespoonful of castor oil. In the case of certain well known anthelmintics, oil must be
avoided, but better results are obtained with this remedy in getting rid of the
worm, after the paralyzing influence of chenopodium. Perhaps more care
should be taken in our country to avoid such complications as nephritis and
paralysis, but foreign prescribers account the remedy as harmless in the
above described doses.

Toxicity—In addition to the conditions named above which may be
induced are persistent inclination to sleep, great drowsiness, and depression.
The agent, if these symptoms appear, should be withheld, and the patient
stimulated with strong coffee or other available stimulant, and wakefulness
induced, as after opium.

There is little doubt that this will now immediately become the most dependable of our remedies for hookworn, as well as being reliable for other
intestinal parasites.

ASPIDIUM. ASPIDIUM FELIX-MAS.

Synonym—Male fern.

ConstitveNts—Felicic, felixolic, felosmylic, tomaspidic and pteritannic
acids, volatile oil, wax, chlorophyll, gallic acid, albumen, pectin, starch, gum,
sugar, salts.

PREPARATIONS—Oleoresina Aspidii, Oleoresin of Aspidium. Dose, from six
to eight grains.

Therapy—A most active gastro-intestinal irritant, it is given to remove
tapeworm. The oleoresin is given in doses of half a dram in capsules. One-

half to one dram of the fluid extract may be given, or half an ounce of the
leaves are steeped in half a pint of water and this is taken before breakfast.
Oils should not be given after this agent, as they facilitate the absorption of
its toxic principle which exercises a profound influence upon the nervous
system. Saline laxatives or vegetable laxatives may be administered. The
usual preparation of the patient is essential and it is necessary to follow the
removal of the worm with mild tonics and restoratives. Unlike those often
used, this agent does not produce unpleasant results, being in every way a
safe remedy if taken in proper doses.
It does not impair the appetite or reduce the strength.

CONVOLVULUS. CONVOLVULUS SCAMMONIA.

Synonym—Scammony.

aa aa (seammonin, identical with jalapin), gum, fibre,
starch.

PREPARATIONS—Resina Scammonie, Resin of Scammony. Dose, from three
to eight grains.

Therapy—Scammony is a vermifuge and is useful in combination with
other vermifuges to increase their action. It also acts as a cathartic for their
removal, as its cathartic influence is of considerable importance. It is hydragogue and irritating in large doses and more or less depressing. It has a certain eliminative influence, and like podophyllum, has been given in conjunction with alteratives. It is greatly superseded in this line of action, by many
other of our agents better known.

MALLOTUS. MALLOTUS PHILIPPINENSIS.

Synonyms—Kamala, Kameela.

ConstiTuenNts—Resin 80 per cent, citric, oxalic and tannin acids, rottlerin,
malotoxin, paraoxybenzoic acid.

PrEPaRATIONS—Specifie Kamala. Dose, from thirty to sixty minims.

Therapy—Kamala is an efficient remedy for tapeworm, ranking next to
male fern. No preparation for its administration is necessary. To counteract griping it should be taken in cinnamon water or combined with hyoscyamus. If the first does does not act, it should be repeated in four hours
or followed with a dose of castor oil.

Kamala may be employed as an external application in herpetic ringworm, scabies and other skin diseases.

BRAYERA. BRAYERA ANTHELMINTICA:

Synonym—Kousso.

Const1TveNTs—Brayerin (a bitter, acrid resin), volatile oil, tannin.

PREPARATIONS—Extractum Kousso Fluidum, Fluid Extracts of Kousso.
Dose, from one to six drams.

py—Kousso is given for the removal of the tapeworm. An infusion of half an ounce in a pint of water should be made and drunk on rising
in the morning. The patient should take but little food during the day, and
if the bowels do not move freely, a physic should be taken at night. An ex-

tractive is obtained from the plant, known as Koosin, which is given in doses
of twenty grains. The fluid extract in two dram doses is also given. The
agent is said to possess abortive properties. All intestinal irritants should
be given with care in pregnancy.

GRANATUM. PUNICA GRANATUM.

Synonym—Pomegranate.

Constirvents—Pelletierine, a colorless liquid, soluble in twenty parts of
cold water, freely soluble in alcohol. Acted upon by sulphuric, hydrochloric,
or hydrobromic acids, a crystalline salt is formed in each case. With tannic
acid, the tannate of pelletierine is formed, a yellowish powder, odorless, pungent, astringent.

Dose of the alkaloid, from one-tenth to one-half grain. Dose of the salts
of the alkaloid, from one to five grains. Extractum Granatum Fluidum.
Fluid Extract of Granatum. Dose, from fifteen to thirty minims.

Physiological Action—Pomegranate has an astringent influence quite
marked, at the same time in full doses it produces evacuation of the bowel,
and in some cases irritation and emesis may be induced. A decoction of the
fresh bark of the root will produce the best results, when the anthelmintic
influence of the agent is desired.

Therapy—It is a specific for the destruction of the tapeworm. Two
ounces of the fresh bark is macerated in two pints of water for twenty-four
hours, when it is then boiled down to one pint. After fasting one day, the
patient may take a wine-glass of this every hour, until the pint is taken. It
may induce vomiting and purging, but if the bowels do not move freely, a
physic should be given near the end of the treatment, or sometimes a glycerine enema will be sufficient. If not at first successful, the treatment should
be repeated within a few days. When the fresh bark cannot be obtained, the
alkaloid or its salts may be resorted to. This agent has been used in diarrhea
and in colliquative night sweats. In bronchorrhea and as a gargle in various
forms of sort throat, it has produced good results. It has been used both
internally and as a douche in leucorrhea.
