## Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 (T1DM)

### Etiology & Risk Factors
**Primary Cause:** T1DM is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease resulting in the selective destruction of pancreatic $\beta$-cells within the Islets of Langerhans.
*   **Genetic Susceptibility:** Strongly associated with the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6p21.
    *   **High Risk Haplotypes:** **HLA-DR3-DQ2** and **HLA-DR4-DQ8**. Heterozygotes (DR3/DR4) carry the highest risk (odds ratio ~15).
    *   **Non-HLA Genes:** Polymorphisms in the insulin gene (*INS*), *PTPN22* (lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase), and *CTLA4* (T-cell regulation) contribute to immune dysregulation.
*   **Environmental Triggers:**
    *   **Viral Infections:** Enteroviruses (e.g., Coxsackievirus B) may induce $\beta$-cell injury or molecular mimicry.
    *   **Dietary Factors:** Early exposure to cow's milk proteins (bovine insulin, albumin) or gluten in genetically susceptible infants.
    *   **Gut Microbiome:** Dysbiosis may compromise intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"), facilitating antigen exposure.

### Molecular & Cellular Pathogenesis
The core defect is the **loss of immune tolerance** to $\beta$-cell autoantigens (e.g., insulin, GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8).
1.  **Initiation:** An environmental trigger in a genetically susceptible host leads to the presentation of $\beta$-cell antigens by Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) to autoreactive CD4+ T-helper cells.
2.  **Insulitis:** Infiltration of the pancreatic islets by immune cells.
    *   **CD8+ Cytotoxic T-cells:** The primary effectors of $\beta$-cell death via perforin/granzyme release and Fas-FasL interactions.
    *   **CD4+ Th1 Cells:** Secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (**IFN-$\gamma$**, **TNF-$\alpha$**, **IL-1$\beta$**) which upregulate MHC Class I expression on $\beta$-cells (making them visible targets) and induce oxidative stress/apoptosis.
    *   **B-cells:** Produce autoantibodies (markers of disease, but less pathogenic than T-cells).
3.  **$\beta$-cell Destruction:** Progressive loss of $\beta$-cell mass. Clinical hyperglycemia manifests only after **80-90%** of $\beta$-cell mass is destroyed.

### Systemic Pathophysiology
**Absolute Insulin Deficiency** leads to a catabolic state mimicking starvation despite hyperglycemia.
*   **Carbohydrate Metabolism:** Unrestrained hepatic **gluconeogenesis** and **glycogenolysis** (due to lack of insulin suppression and unopposed glucagon). Reduced peripheral glucose uptake (GLUT4 remains intracellular in muscle/adipose). Result: **Severe Hyperglycemia**.
*   **Lipid Metabolism:** Loss of insulin's inhibitory effect on hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipocytes.
    *   **Lipolysis:** Massive release of Free Fatty Acids (FFAs).
    *   **Ketogenesis:** Liver converts FFAs $\rightarrow$ Acetyl-CoA $\rightarrow$ Ketone bodies (Acetoacetate, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, Acetone). Accumulation exceeds buffering capacity $\rightarrow$ **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**.
*   **Protein Metabolism:** Increased proteolysis in skeletal muscle releases amino acids (alanine, glutamine) for hepatic gluconeogenesis, causing muscle wasting and negative nitrogen balance.

### Pathophysiological Cascade
**[Flow: Insulin Deficiency & Ketoacidosis]**
1.  **Initial Insult:** **Absolute Insulin Deficiency** + Unopposed Glucagon.
2.  **Compensatory Response:** **Catabolism**. Body perceives "starvation" $\rightarrow$ breaks down fat (lipolysis) and muscle (proteolysis) for fuel.
3.  **Maladaptive Consequence:**
    *   **Hyperglycemia:** Liver pumps out glucose (gluconeogenesis) but cells can't use it.
    *   **Ketoacidosis:** Massive FFA release $\rightarrow$ liver makes ketones $\rightarrow$ blood pH drops (<7.3).
    *   **Osmotic Diuresis:** Glucose spills into urine $\rightarrow$ pulls water with it $\rightarrow$ severe dehydration.
4.  **Symptom Mechanism:**
    *   **Kussmaul Respirations:** Acidosis stimulates respiratory center $\rightarrow$ deep, rapid breathing to blow off CO2 (compensatory respiratory alkalosis).
    *   **Polyuria/Polydipsia:** Hyperosmolar blood triggers thirst; glycosuria drives urine output.

### Clinical Correlations
*   **Polyuria:** Hyperglycemia exceeds the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption (~180 mg/dL) $\rightarrow$ glycosuria $\rightarrow$ **osmotic diuresis**.
*   **Polydipsia:** Hyperosmolarity and volume depletion stimulate hypothalamic osmoreceptors $\rightarrow$ intense thirst.
*   **Polyphagia:** Cellular "starvation" (intracellular hypoglycemia) stimulates hypothalamic appetite centers.
*   **Weight Loss:** Due to fluid loss, lipolysis, and proteolysis.
*   **Kussmaul Respirations:** Deep, rapid breathing to compensate for metabolic acidosis (DKA) by blowing off CO$_2$.

### Diagnostic Biomarkers
*   **Autoantibodies:** Anti-GAD65, Anti-IA-2, Anti-ZnT8, Insulin Autoantibodies (IAA). Presence confirms autoimmune etiology.
*   **C-Peptide:** Low or undetectable (<0.6 ng/mL), reflecting negligible endogenous insulin secretion.
*   **HbA1c:** Elevated (often >10% at diagnosis).
*   **Ketones:** Positive in serum ($\beta$-hydroxybutyrate) and urine.

## Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (T2DM)

### Etiology & Risk Factors
**Primary Cause:** A complex interplay of **insulin resistance** and **relative insulin deficiency** ($\beta$-cell dysfunction).
*   **Genetics:** Polygenic inheritance. Variants in *TCF7L2* (impairs insulin secretion), *PPARG*, and *KCNJ11*.
*   **Environmental/Lifestyle:**
    *   **Obesity:** Specifically **visceral adiposity** (central obesity).
    *   **Sedentary Lifestyle:** Reduces skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.
    *   **Age:** Mitochondrial aging reduces $\beta$-cell function.

### Molecular & Cellular Pathogenesis
1.  **Insulin Resistance (Peripheral Tissues):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Ectopic lipid accumulation (diacylglycerol, ceramides) in muscle and liver interferes with insulin signaling.
    *   **Signaling Defect:** Serine phosphorylation (inhibitory) of **Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1)** prevents downstream activation of PI3K-Akt pathway.
    *   **Consequence:** Impaired translocation of **GLUT4** vesicles to the plasma membrane $\rightarrow$ reduced glucose uptake.
2.  **$\beta$-cell Dysfunction:**
    *   **Glucotoxicity:** Chronic hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress (ROS) in $\beta$-cells.
    *   **Lipotoxicity:** Elevated FFAs cause ER stress and apoptosis.
    *   **Amyloid Deposition:** Co-secretion of **Amylin** (Islet Amyloid Polypeptide) aggregates into toxic amyloid fibrils, destroying $\beta$-cells.

### Systemic Pathophysiology
*   **Hyperinsulinemia (Early Phase):** $\beta$-cells undergo hyperplasia and hypertrophy to compensate for insulin resistance. Normoglycemia is maintained.
*   **$\beta$-cell Failure (Late Phase):** Compensation fails. Insulin secretion declines (though often remains higher than in healthy individuals, it is insufficient for the degree of resistance).
*   **Hepatic Glucose Output:** Insulin resistance in the liver leads to failure to suppress gluconeogenesis during fasting $\rightarrow$ **Fasting Hyperglycemia**.
*   **Incretin Effect:** Blunted response to GLP-1 and GIP, reducing meal-stimulated insulin secretion.

### Pathophysiological Cascade
**[Flow: Resistance & Exhaustion]**
1.  **Initial Insult:** **Insulin Resistance** (Receptor signaling defect).
2.  **Compensatory Response:** **Hyperinsulinemia**. $\beta$-cells work overtime to overcome resistance and maintain normoglycemia.
3.  **Maladaptive Consequence:**
    *   **$\beta$-cell Exhaustion:** Oxidative stress and amyloid deposition kill $\beta$-cells.
    *   **Glucotoxicity:** Chronic high glucose damages endothelium (microvascular) and nerves (polyol pathway).
4.  **Symptom Mechanism:**
    *   **Fatigue:** Cells are "starving" despite high blood glucose because GLUT4 transporters aren't opening.
    *   **Paresthesias:** High glucose damages Schwann cells $\rightarrow$ demyelination of peripheral nerves.

### Clinical Correlations
*   **Acanthosis Nigricans:** Hyperpigmented, velvety plaques in axillae/neck. High insulin levels stimulate IGF-1 receptors on keratinocytes and fibroblasts.
*   **Central Obesity:** "Apple" body shape, associated with high visceral fat and metabolic syndrome.
*   **Microvascular Complications:** Retinopathy, Nephropathy, Neuropathy (due to chronic glycation of proteins and oxidative stress).
*   **Macrovascular Complications:** Accelerated atherosclerosis (MI, Stroke) driven by dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction.

### Diagnostic Biomarkers
*   **HbA1c:** $\ge$ 6.5% (Diagnostic).
*   **Fasting Plasma Glucose:** $\ge$ 126 mg/dL.
*   **C-Peptide:** Normal or Elevated (indicating insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia), unlike T1DM.
*   **HOMA-IR:** Calculated score indicating degree of insulin resistance.

## Metabolic Syndrome (Syndrome X)

### Etiology & Risk Factors
A cluster of conditions that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.
*   **Central Obesity:** The driving force. Visceral adipose tissue is metabolically active and pro-inflammatory.
*   **Insulin Resistance:** The common denominator linking all components.

### Molecular & Cellular Pathogenesis
**Adiposopathy (Sick Fat):**
*   **Adipokine Imbalance:** Visceral fat secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines (**TNF-$\alpha$**, **IL-6**) and reduces anti-inflammatory **Adiponectin**.
*   **Free Fatty Acid Flux:** Direct drainage of visceral fat into the portal vein exposes the liver to high FFA loads $\rightarrow$ hepatic insulin resistance and increased VLDL synthesis.
*   **Endothelial Dysfunction:** Insulin resistance impairs NO production, leading to vasoconstriction and hypertension.

### Systemic Pathophysiology
The "Deadly Quartet":
1.  **Dyslipidemia:** High Triglycerides, Low HDL, small dense LDL (highly atherogenic).
2.  **Hypertension:** Hyperinsulinemia increases renal Na+ reabsorption and sympathetic tone.
3.  **Hyperglycemia:** Insulin resistance.
4.  **Abdominal Obesity:** Waist circumference >40 in (men), >35 in (women).

### Pathophysiological Cascade
**[Flow: Visceral Adiposity & Systemic Inflammation]**
1.  **Initial Insult:** **Visceral Fat Accumulation**.
2.  **Compensatory Response:** **Adipokine Secretion**. Fat tissue tries to regulate metabolism but becomes dysregulated (High TNF-$\alpha$, Low Adiponectin).
3.  **Maladaptive Consequence:**
    *   **Lipotoxicity:** FFAs flood the liver $\rightarrow$ VLDL overproduction $\rightarrow$ High Triglycerides.
    *   **Endothelial Dysfunction:** Inflammation reduces Nitric Oxide $\rightarrow$ Hypertension.
4.  **Symptom Mechanism:**
    *   **Central Obesity:** Visceral fat accumulation pushes abdominal wall outward ("beer belly").
    *   **Acanthosis Nigricans:** High insulin stimulates skin cell growth factors $\rightarrow$ dark, velvety patches.

### Clinical Correlations
*   **Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD):** Hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Steatosis $\rightarrow$ Steatohepatitis (NASH) $\rightarrow$ Cirrhosis.
*   **PCOS:** Strongly linked to insulin resistance in women.
*   **Sleep Apnea:** Mechanical load + inflammatory cytokines.

### Diagnostic Biomarkers
Diagnosis requires $\ge$ 3 of 5 criteria (NCEP ATP III):
1.  **Waist Circumference:** >102 cm (M), >88 cm (F).
2.  **Triglycerides:** $\ge$ 150 mg/dL.
3.  **HDL Cholesterol:** <40 mg/dL (M), <50 mg/dL (F).
4.  **Blood Pressure:** $\ge$ 130/85 mmHg.
5.  **Fasting Glucose:** $\ge$ 100 mg/dL.

## Thyroid Disorders

### Hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's Thyroiditis)

#### Etiology
Autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland. Most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions.

#### Molecular Pathogenesis
*   **Autoantibodies:**
    *   **Anti-TPO (Thyroid Peroxidase):** Targets the enzyme responsible for iodine organification.
    *   **Anti-Tg (Thyroglobulin):** Targets the prohormone storage protein.
*   **Cellular Mechanism:** Lymphocytic infiltration (T-cells) leads to apoptosis of thyrocytes and fibrosis.

#### Systemic Pathophysiology
**Decreased T3/T4:**
*   **Metabolic:** Decreased Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Reduced thermogenesis.
*   **Neurologic:** Downregulation of catecholamine receptors $\rightarrow$ lethargy, depression, slow reflexes.
*   **Dermatologic:** Accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronic acid) in interstitial space $\rightarrow$ **Myxedema** (non-pitting edema).

#### Pathophysiological Cascade
**[Flow: Metabolic Slowing & Myxedema]**
1.  **Initial Insult:** **Thyroid Failure** (Low T3/T4).
2.  **Compensatory Response:** **TSH Surge**. Pituitary screams at thyroid to work harder.
3.  **Maladaptive Consequence:**
    *   **Hypometabolism:** Mitochondria produce less ATP/Heat.
    *   **GAG Accumulation:** Fibroblasts secrete glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronic acid) into skin/interstitium due to lack of T3 inhibition.
4.  **Symptom Mechanism:**
    *   **Cold Intolerance:** Lack of thermogenesis.
    *   **Myxedema:** GAGs are hydrophilic $\rightarrow$ pull water into tissues $\rightarrow$ non-pitting edema (puffy face).

### Clinical Correlations
*   **Cold Intolerance:** Reduced thermogenesis.
*   **Weight Gain:** Decreased BMR.
*   **Bradycardia:** Reduced $\beta$-adrenergic sensitivity.
*   **Goiter:** TSH stimulation causes thyroid enlargement (early stage) or atrophy (late fibrosis).

#### Diagnostic Biomarkers
*   **TSH:** Elevated (Primary Hypothyroidism). Most sensitive screening test.
*   **Free T4:** Low.
*   **Anti-TPO Antibodies:** Positive in >90% of Hashimoto's.

### Hyperthyroidism (Graves' Disease)

#### Etiology
Autoimmune disorder caused by Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulins (TSI).

#### Molecular Pathogenesis
*   **Mechanism:** TSI (an IgG antibody) binds to the **TSH Receptor** on thyroid follicular cells and **activates** it (mimicking TSH).
*   **Unregulated Stimulation:** Unlike TSH, TSI is not subject to negative feedback. Leads to constitutive synthesis and release of T3/T4.

#### Systemic Pathophysiology
**Thyrotoxicosis:**
*   **Metabolic:** Hypermetabolism, increased O$_2$ consumption, heat production.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Upregulation of $\beta$1-adrenergic receptors $\rightarrow$ tachycardia, increased contractility, atrial fibrillation.
*   **Ophthalmopathy:** TSH receptors are also expressed on orbital fibroblasts. TSI stimulation $\rightarrow$ glycosaminoglycan deposition $\rightarrow$ retro-orbital edema $\rightarrow$ **Exophthalmos**.

#### Pathophysiological Cascade
**[Flow: Hypermetabolism & Adrenergic Overdrive]**
1.  **Initial Insult:** **TSI Autoantibody** activates TSH receptor.
2.  **Compensatory Response:** **None**. Negative feedback loop is broken (TSH is low, but thyroid ignores it).
3.  **Maladaptive Consequence:**
    *   **Hypermetabolism:** Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation $\rightarrow$ heat generation.
    *   **Adrenergic Upregulation:** T3 increases sensitivity/number of $\beta$-adrenergic receptors.
4.  **Symptom Mechanism:**
    *   **Tachycardia/Palpitations:** Heart is hypersensitive to normal adrenaline levels.
    *   **Exophthalmos:** TSH receptors behind eyes are activated $\rightarrow$ fat/muscle swelling pushes eyes forward.

### Clinical Correlations
*   **Heat Intolerance/Sweating:** Hypermetabolism.
*   **Weight Loss:** Despite increased appetite.
*   **Tremor/Anxiety:** Sympathetic overactivity.
*   **Pretibial Myxedema:** Infiltrative dermopathy (rare).

#### Diagnostic Biomarkers
*   **TSH:** Suppressed (<0.05 mIU/L).
*   **Free T4/T3:** Elevated.
*   **TSI (Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin):** Positive (Specific for Graves').
*   **Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU):** Diffuse, high uptake.
