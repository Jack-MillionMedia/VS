# The Foundation: 5 Non-Negotiables

**Before we get to routines, these 5 things matter MORE than any herb:**

## 1. Sleep: 7-9 Hours (The #1 Game-Changer)

**Why it's non-negotiable:** 
- <6 hours = 400% higher illness risk
- Affects every system (immune, hormonal, mental, digestive)
- No amount of herbs can compensate for sleep deprivation

**Your action:** 
- Set non-negotiable bedtime (work backward from wake time)
- Same time every night (even weekends)
- See [Sleep Support Guide](./Sleep-Support-Natural-Guide.md) for full protocol

**If you do nothing else, FIX YOUR SLEEP.**

---

## 2. Move: 30 Minutes Daily (More Important Than Gym)

**Why it's non-negotiable:**
- Reduces inflammation
- Boosts immunity
- Improves mental health
- Enhances digestion
- Better than meditation for stress

**Your action:**
- Walk 30 minutes (that's it—doesn't need to be fancy)
- Morning walk = best (sunlight exposure + movement)
- Can break into 3x 10-minute sessions

---

## 3. Eat Real Food: 80% Whole Foods

**Why it's non-negotiable:**
- Herbs can't fix a terrible diet
- Processed food drives inflammation
- Whole foods provide nutrients herbs can't replace

**Your action:**
- Protein at every meal (stabilizes blood sugar)
- 5+ servings vegetables daily
- Minimize ultra-processed foods
- Cook at home 5+ days/week

---

## 4. Hydrate: Half Your Body Weight in Ounces

**Why it's non-negotiable:**
- Dehydration mimics anxiety, fatigue, brain fog
- Necessary for detox and cellular function
- Most people are chronically dehydrated

**Your action:**
- Drink 8-10 glasses water daily
- More if exercising or in hot weather
- Herbal tea counts!

---

## 5. Stress Management: 10 Minutes Daily

**Why it's non-negotiable:**
- Chronic stress suppresses immunity
- Affects digestion, sleep, hormones
- Adaptogens help but can't fix toxic stress alone

**Your action:**
- Pick ONE: meditation, journaling, deep breathing, yoga, nature time
- 10 minutes minimum, same time daily
- Non-negotiable appointment with yourself

---

# The Habit-Stacking Method

**How to make these routines STICK:**

## Start with Anchor Habits

**Anchor = existing habit you already do daily**

**Examples:**
- "After I brush my teeth..." → drink lemon water
- "While my coffee brews..." → take morning adaptogens
- "After I sit down at desk..." → drink herbal tea
- "Before I start dinner..." → take digestive bitters
- "When I turn on TV..." → sip chamomile tea

**Why it works:** Links new habit to established routine

---

## The 1% Rule: Start Tiny

**Don't try to do everything at once!**

### Week 1: Add ONE Thing
- Example: Morning lemon water

### Week 2: Add ONE More
- Keep week 1 habit
- Add: Evening chamomile tea

### Week 3: Add ONE More
- Keep weeks 1-2
- Add: Midday walk

### Week 4: Add ONE More
- Keep weeks 1-3
- Add: Morning adaptogens

**By month end:** You have 4 new habits that feel automatic

---

## The 2-Day Rule

**You can miss 1 day. Never miss 2 in a row.**

**Why it works:**
- Life happens—one miss is OK
- Two misses = broken habit
- Gets you back on track immediately

**Example:** 
- Forgot morning routine Monday? No problem.
- Tuesday: MUST do it (or habit breaks)

---

## Environment Design

**Make good habits easy, bad habits hard**

**Set up your environment:**
- **Nightstand:** Put morning supplements, water bottle, lemon
- **Kitchen counter:** Visible tea station, herbs in jars
- **Desk:** Herbal tea supplies, water bottle
- **Bathroom:** Reminder sticky note on mirror
- **Phone:** Alarms for herb-taking times

**Remove temptations:**
- Move junk food out of sight
- Delete time-wasting apps
- Hide TV remote (make it harder to collapse on couch)

---

# Troubleshooting: "I Can't Stick to a Routine"

## Problem: "I don't have time"

**Reality check:** You have time for what you prioritize.

**Solutions:**
- Start with 5-minute habits only
- Combine habits (walk while listening to podcast, sip tea while reading)
- Cut time-wasters (1 hour less TV = time for full routine)
- Wake up 30 minutes earlier (go to bed 30 minutes earlier)

**Truth:** Most people waste 2-3 hours daily on screens. You have time.

---

## Problem: "I forget"

**Solutions:**
- Phone alarms (every herb-taking time)
- Habit tracking app (Habitica, Streaks, Productive)
- Visual reminders (sticky notes, herbs on counter)
- Accountability partner (text a friend daily)
- Anchor to existing habits (see Habit-Stacking above)

---

## Problem: "I'm not seeing results"

**Check:**
- Have you been consistent for 4+ weeks? (Most herbs need this long)
- Are you doing the 5 non-negotiables? (If not, start there)
- Are you using quality herbs? (Poor quality = poor results)
- Are you taking effective doses? (Too little won't work)
- Is lifestyle sabotaging herbs? (Terrible sleep + stress + junk food = herbs can't compensate)

**Reality:** Herbs work for 70-80% of people who use them correctly AND address lifestyle.

---

## Problem: "It feels overwhelming"

**Solution:** You're trying to do too much at once.

**Restart:**
1. Pick ONE thing from this guide

4. Repeat

**Progress > perfection**
