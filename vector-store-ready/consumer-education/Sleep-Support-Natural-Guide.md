# Sleep Hygiene: Make Your Herbs Work Better

**Herbs are TOOLS, not magic bullets.** They work best when combined with good sleep habits.

## The Non-Negotiables

### 1. Consistent Sleep Schedule
- Go to bed and wake up at same time (even weekends!)
- Trains your body's internal clock
- **Makes herbs 3x more effective**

### 2. Dark, Cool, Quiet Room
- 60-67°F ideal temperature
- Blackout curtains or eye mask
- White noise machine if needed
- Remove ALL light sources (even tiny LEDs)

### 3. No Screens 1 Hour Before Bed
- Blue light suppresses melatonin
- Stimulating content keeps mind alert
- **Switch to:** Reading (paper books), journaling, gentle stretching, herb tea ritual

### 4. Caffeine Cutoff
- No caffeine after 2pm (or earlier if sensitive)
- Includes coffee, tea, soda, chocolate, pre-workout
- Caffeine half-life = 5-6 hours (stays in system long time)

### 5. Light Exercise (But Not Close to Bedtime)
- 30 min daily movement improves sleep
- But finish vigorous exercise 3+ hours before bed
- **Evening:** Gentle yoga, walking, stretching only

### 6. Magnesium
- ~50% of people are deficient
- Magnesium glycinate: 200-400mg before bed
- Supports muscle relaxation and nervous system
- **Combines beautifully with herbs**

---

# Troubleshooting: When Herbs Aren't Working

## "I've tried chamomile and it does nothing."

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase dose:** Try 2-3 teaspoons instead of 1
2. **Steep longer:** 10-15 min covered (preserve oils)
3. **Try stronger herb:** Valerian or passionflower
4. **Combine herbs:** Chamomile + lavender + lemon balm
5. **Check sleep hygiene:** Herbs can't overcome terrible habits

---

## "Valerian makes me groggy the next day."

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce dose:** Try 300mg instead of 600mg
2. **Take earlier:** 2 hours before bed instead of 1 hour
3. **Try different brand:** Quality varies significantly
4. **Switch herbs:** Passionflower or California poppy instead

---

## "I fall asleep but wake up at 3am."

**This is often cortisol-related (stress). Try:**
1. **Ashwagandha:** 300-600mg daily (regulates cortisol)
2. **Holy basil:** 2-3 cups tea daily (HPA axis support)
3. **Blood sugar:** Small protein snack before bed (prevents crashes)
4. **Magnesium:** 400mg at bedtime
5. **Address root cause:** Stress management, therapy, lifestyle changes

---

## "Nothing works—I've tried everything."

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Sleep apnea:** GET TESTED—this is medical condition requiring treatment
2. **Medication side effects:** Many meds disrupt sleep (ask doctor)
3. **Underlying condition:** Depression, thyroid issues, chronic pain
4. **Not long enough:** Some herbs need 4-6 weeks
5. **Poor quality herbs:** Switch to reputable suppliers

**See a doctor if:**
- Insomnia lasting >3 months
- Daytime impairment (falling asleep at work, dangerous situations)
- Loud snoring + gasping at night (sleep apnea)
- Unexplained daytime fatigue despite "sleeping" 7-8 hours
