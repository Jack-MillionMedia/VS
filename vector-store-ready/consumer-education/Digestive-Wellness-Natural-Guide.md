# Understanding Your Digestive System

## How Digestion Should Work

**The perfect digestive process:**
1. **Mouth:** Chewing + saliva starts carb digestion
2. **Stomach:** Acid + enzymes break down protein
3. **Small intestine:** Nutrients absorbed; bile and pancreatic enzymes digest fats
4. **Large intestine:** Water absorbed; gut bacteria ferment fiber
5. **Elimination:** Regular, comfortable bowel movements

**When it works well:** You don't even think about digestion. No bloating, gas, pain, or irregular bowel movements.

**When it doesn't:** Multiple things can go wrong at each stage—and herbs can help!

# Lifestyle Strategies (Make Herbs Work Better)

## The Digestion-Friendly Lifestyle

### 1. How You Eat Matters MORE Than What You Eat

**Slow down:**
- Chew each bite 20-30 times
- Put fork down between bites
- Take 20-30 minutes per meal
- Don't eat while stressed or distracted

**Why it matters:** Digestion starts in the mouth. Rushing = swallowed air (gas) + poor breakdown (bloating).

---

### 2. Meal Timing & Size

**Best practices:**
- Eat at consistent times daily
- Don't skip meals (irregular eating = irregular digestion)
- Smaller, more frequent meals if digestive system is weak
- Stop eating 2-3 hours before bed
- Breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, dinner like a pauper

---

### 3. Hydration (But Not With Meals)

**Do:**
- Drink 8-10 glasses water daily
- Drink between meals

**Don't:**
- Drink large amounts WITH meals (dilutes stomach acid and enzymes)
- Drink ice-cold water (shocks digestion)

**Best:** Room temperature or warm water

---

### 4. Food Combining (Can Help Some People)

**Principles:**
- Don't combine proteins + starches in large amounts (different digestion requirements)
- Eat fruit alone or before meals (digests quickly)
- If digestion is very weak, simplify meals

**Note:** Not everyone needs this, but helpful for weak digestion

---

### 5. Exercise (But Not Right After Eating)

**Good:**
- Gentle 10-15 min walk after meals (aids digestion)
- Regular daily exercise (improves motility)

**Bad:**
- Vigorous exercise right after eating (diverts blood from digestion)
- Sedentary lifestyle (slows motility)

---

### 6. Stress Management

**Critical for digestion:**
- "Rest and digest" nervous system needs to be active
- Stress shuts down digestion
- Take 3-5 deep breaths before eating
- Don't eat while angry, anxious, or upset

---

### 7. Foods to Emphasize

**Digestive-friendly:**
- **Fermented foods:** Sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, yogurt (probiotics)
- **Fiber:** Vegetables, fruits, whole grains (feeds good bacteria, promotes motility)
- **Bone broth:** Healing for gut lining
- **Probiotic foods:** Support healthy gut bacteria
- **Cooked vegetables:** Easier to digest than raw (if digestion is weak)

---

### 8. Foods to Limit (If Sensitive)

**Common triggers:**
- **High-FODMAP foods:** Beans, onions, garlic, wheat, dairy (if IBS)
- **Gluten:** If sensitive or celiac
- **Dairy:** If lactose intolerant
- **Spicy foods:** If you have GERD or ulcers
- **High-fat foods:** If you have poor fat digestion
- **Caffeine & alcohol:** Irritate gut lining

**Note:** Keep food journal to identify YOUR triggers

# Troubleshooting

## "The herbs aren't working."

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Wrong herb for your issue:** Match herb to specific problem
2. **Not addressing diet/lifestyle:** Herbs can't overcome terrible habits
3. **Dose too low:** Try increasing (within safe range)
4. **Underlying condition:** May need medical evaluation
5. **Food intolerances:** Try elimination diet

---

## "Peppermint makes my heartburn worse."

**Why:** Peppermint relaxes lower esophageal sphincter

**Solution:** Avoid peppermint if you have GERD; use chamomile, ginger, or slippery elm instead

---

## "I'm MORE bloated with fiber herbs."

**Why:** Too much fiber too fast, or imbalanced gut bacteria

**Solution:**
- Increase fiber slowly
- Drink more water
- Consider probiotics
- May have SIBO (bacterial overgrowth)—see doctor

---
