# Why Quality Matters

## You Get What You Pay For (Usually)

**The harsh truth:**

- 20-40% of herbal products on the market are low quality
- Some contain little to no active herb
- Others are contaminated with pesticides, heavy metals, or fillers
- Many are simply old and have lost potency

**What this means for you:**

- Wasted money on products that don't work
- Frustration ("herbs don't work for me!")
- Potential safety concerns

**Good news:** Learning to spot quality is easy once you know what to look for!

✅ **Vibrant color** (not faded or dull)  
✅ **Strong aroma** (characteristic smell of the herb)  
✅ **Proper plant part** (leaf, root, flower—as specified)  
✅ **Minimal stems/debris** (clean, processed properly)  
✅ **Latin name on label** (confirms correct species)  
✅ **Harvest/expiration date** (freshness matters)  
✅ **Third-party testing** (verification of purity)  
✅ **Reputable supplier** (established company with good reviews)

# How to Evaluate Dried Herbs

## Visual Inspection

### Color: The #1 Quality Indicator

**Good:**

- **Green herbs** (peppermint, nettle, basil): Deep, vibrant green
- **Flowers** (chamomile, lavender): Rich color, not faded
- **Roots** (ginger, turmeric): Tan to brown (not gray or black)

**Bad:**

- Faded, washed-out colors
- Brown when should be green
- Gray or black (oxidation or mold)
- Dusty appearance

**Test:** Hold herb to light—should have depth of color, not translucent/faded

---

### Appearance: What You Should See

**Good:**

- Whole or large pieces (more potent than powder)
- Clean (minimal stems, sticks, debris)
- Consistent size
- Dry but not crumbly

**Bad:**

- Excessive stems and debris
- Powder when you ordered whole herb (unless you wanted powder)
- Moisture or clumping (mold risk)
- Extremely brittle/dusty (over-dried or old)

---

## Smell: The Potency Test

**How to test:**

1. Open container
2. Smell immediately (don't wait—oils dissipate)
3. Should smell STRONGLY of the characteristic herb aroma

**Good:** Powerful, unmistakable scent  
**Bad:** Weak smell or no smell at all  
**Terrible:** Musty, moldy, or "off" smell

**Examples:**

- **Peppermint:** Should make your nose tingle
- **Lavender:** Strong floral aroma
- **Chamomile:** Sweet, apple-like scent
- **Ginger:** Spicy, pungent

**No smell = No potency = Wasted money**

---

## Touch: The Texture Test

**Fresh herbs should:**

- Be dry (not damp)
- Have some flexibility (not crumble to dust instantly)
- Release aroma when crushed
- Feel clean (not gritty or sandy)

**Crush test:**

- Take a small piece
- Crush between fingers
- Should release STRONG aroma
- Should break cleanly (not turn to powder or stay tough)

---

# Reading Labels Like a Pro

## Essential Label Information

### 1. Latin/Botanical Name (Critical!)

**Why it matters:** Common names vary; Latin names are exact

**Examples of confusion:**

- "Ginseng" could be:
  - _Panax ginseng_ (Asian ginseng—stimulating)
  - _Panax quinquefolius_ (American ginseng—calming)
  - _Eleutherococcus senticosus_ (Siberian "ginseng"—not true ginseng)

**All three work differently!**

**Always check:** Label should list Latin name (genus + species)

---

### 2. Plant Part Used

**Why it matters:** Different parts have different compounds

**Example: Dandelion**

- **Root:** Liver support, bitter digestive
- **Leaf:** Diuretic, rich in minerals
- **Whole plant:** General mix

**Always check:** Label specifies leaf, root, flower, berry, etc.

---

### 3. Harvest/Expiration Date

**Freshness matters:**

- **Dried herbs:** Best within 6-12 months
- **Powders:** Lose potency faster (6 months ideal)
- **Tinctures:** Stable 3-5 years
- **Capsules:** Check expiration date

**Red flag:** No date listed

---

### 4. Country of Origin

**Why it matters:**

- Different regions have different regulations
- Soil quality affects mineral content
- Pollution concerns in some areas

**Generally good:** USA, Canada, Europe (strict regulations)  
**More caution:** China, India (unless certified organic + tested)

**Note:** Many herbs ONLY grow in certain regions—this doesn't mean bad quality, just check for testing

---

### 5. Organic Certification

**Look for:**

- USDA Organic seal
- Certified Organic label
- Specific certifying body listed

**Why it matters:**

- No synthetic pesticides
- No GMOs
- Better for environment
- Often fresher (organic farms tend to be smaller, more careful)

**When it matters MOST:** Herbs you consume frequently or in large amounts

---

### 6. Third-Party Testing

**Best labels show:**

- USP Verified (United States Pharmacopeia)
- NSF Certified
- ConsumerLab tested
- Certificate of Analysis (CoA) available on request

**What they test for:**

- Identity (correct herb)
- Purity (no contaminants)
- Potency (active compounds present)
- Heavy metals
- Microbial contamination

**Red flag:** No mention of testing

---

### 7. Standardization (For Supplements)

**What it means:** Guaranteed amount of active compound

**Example: Turmeric/Curcumin**

- "Standardized to 95% curcuminoids"
- Guarantees potency
- Allows for consistent dosing

**When it matters:** For supplements where you need specific therapeutic dose

**Note:** Not necessary for whole herb teas (natural variation is fine)

---

# Where to Buy: The Good, The Bad, The Sketchy

## ✅ Best Places to Buy

### 1. Specialty Herb Companies (Online)

**Top-tier suppliers:**

- **Mountain Rose Herbs** (excellent quality, organic, fair trade)

---

### 2. Local Health Food Stores

**Pros:**

- Immediate availability

**Cons:**

**What to buy:**

- Fresh culinary/medicinal herbs

- Directly from growers

**Pros:**

- Freshest possible
- Support local farmers

**Best for:** Common herbs like basil, rosemary, mint, lavender

---

### 4. Grocery Stores (Limited Options)

**What's usually OK:**

**Pros:**

- Convenient
- Inexpensive
- Good for basics

**Cons:**

- Limited selection

---

## ⚠️ Use Caution

### Amazon & General Online Marketplaces

**Problems:**

- No quality control
- Third-party sellers (who are they?)
- Fake reviews common
- Products may be old or adulterated

**If you must buy on Amazon:**

- Buy only from known brands with official storefronts
- Check reviews carefully (look for patterns of complaints)
- Verify seller is authorized distributor

**Better option:** Buy directly from manufacturer's website

---

### Supplement Stores (GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, etc.)

**Hit or miss:**

- Some good brands
- Some overpriced, low-quality products
- Check plantz.io shop for many choices

**If you shop here:**

- Compare prices online first

---

## ❌ Avoid

### Gas Stations & Convenience Stores

**Why:**

**Never buy:** "Herbal highs," kratom from gas stations, or any herb from questionable sources

---

### Too-Good-To-Be-True Deals

**Red flags:**

- Prices WAY below market rate
- No company information
- No contact information
- Sketchy website
- Pressure to buy NOW

**Remember:** Quality herbs aren't free. Rock-bottom prices = corners cut somewhere.

# Organic vs. Conventional: When It Matters

## Always Choose Organic (High Priority)

**When you consume:**

- Large amounts (daily tonic herbs)
- Frequently (your go-to herbs)
- Whole leaf/flower (larger surface area for pesticides)

**Examples:**

- Nettle (daily nutritive)
- Chamomile (frequent use)
- Peppermint (large surface area)
- Green tea (daily consumption)

---

## Organic Preferred But Not Critical

**When:**

- Used occasionally
- Small amounts
- Thick skins/peels (less pesticide penetration)

**Examples:**

- Ginger root (thick skin, peeled)
- Turmeric root (thick skin)
- Occasional-use herbs

---

## Conventional May Be OK

**When:**

- Fresh produce you'll peel (garlic, onions)
- Very occasional use
- Budget is extremely tight

**Still prefer organic when possible, but don't let perfect be the enemy of good.**

---

## Whole Herb Advantages

- Takes more space

**Best for:** Most herbs, especially if making tea

---

## Powder Advantages

**Pros:**

# Quick Decision Guide

## Should I Buy This Herb?

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Can I see it?** (Color vibrant? Clean?)
2. **Can I smell it?** (Strong characteristic aroma?)
3. **Is there a Latin name?** (Confirms species)
4. **Is there a date?** (Fresh = potent)
5. **Is it organic?** (Especially for high-use herbs)
6. **Is the supplier reputable?** (Known company, good reviews)
7. **Is the price reasonable?** (Not suspiciously cheap or overpriced)

**If YES to most:** Probably good quality  
**If NO to several:** Keep looking

✅ They actually work (potent compounds present)  
✅ They're safe (tested for contaminants)  
✅ They last longer (stay potent 12+ months)  
✅ You need less (concentrated = cost-effective)  
✅ Better experience (taste, smell, effects)
