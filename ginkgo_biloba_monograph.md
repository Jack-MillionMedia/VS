# Ginkgo biloba - Comprehensive Clinical Monograph

**Context:** Ginkgo biloba is an ancient deciduous tree species, often termed a "living fossil," cultivated for centuries and now one of the world's most popular herbal supplements. This comprehensive monograph provides evidence-based information on traditional uses, pharmacology, clinical applications, safety, and quality considerations for healthcare professionals.

## Introduction

Ginkgo biloba is an ancient deciduous tree species often termed a "living fossil." It has been cultivated for centuries and is now a globally popular herbal supplement. The fan-shaped Ginkgo leaf is used to prepare standardized extracts rich in flavonoids and terpenoids, marketed for memory enhancement and circulatory health. Ginkgo seeds (white nuts) have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for various ailments.

Modern clinical use focuses on cognitive impairment (dementia), peripheral vascular disease, and other neurovascular or neurodegenerative conditions. Ginkgo's pharmacological profile demonstrates antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and microcirculatory effects, making it one of the most researched phytomedicines today.

Despite extensive study, evidence of efficacy is mixed and often nuanced. This monograph provides a comprehensive, evidence-based review supported by current research with structured sections for clarity and depth. Gaps in knowledge and controversies are explicitly noted.

## Traditional and Historical Uses

### Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)

In TCM, Ginkgo seeds (Chinese: Bai Guo, meaning "white fruit") have been recorded in herbal texts since at least the 16th century for their medicinal properties. The seeds are considered astringent and are used to nourish the Lungs, stop wheezing and cough, and secure the Lower Jiao.

TCM indications align with treatments for asthma, bronchitis, and certain genitourinary issues (leukorrhea, frequent urination) due to the seeds' ability to "firm up" leakage and phlegm. Bai Guo is often added to formulas for chronic cough with abundant sputum or for urinary incontinence and vaginal discharge.

Topically, ground Ginkgo seeds were applied to skin infections and sores – a practice validated by modern research identifying antibacterial compounds (ginkgolic acids) in the seed coat.

Ginkgo leaves (Yin Xing Ye) were not a mainstay in classical TCM, but they have been used in some historical contexts for improving "brain function" and blood flow. TCM philosophy attributes Ginkgo leaf with promoting circulation in channels and "opening the channels" to the heart and lungs. Over the last century, as scientific interest grew, TCM practitioners began incorporating Ginkgo leaf extracts for conditions like "brain insufficiency" (cognitive decline), palpitations, and headache/dizziness attributed to blood stasis.

**Bottom line:** In TCM, Ginkgo's seeds are valued for treating chronic cough/asthma and astringing excessive discharges, while leaves (a more modern addition) are used to enhance circulation and cognitive function.

### Western Herbal Adoption

Ginkgo entered Western herbal practice in the late 20th century, propelled by clinical studies in Europe. By the 1980s–1990s, Ginkgo leaf extract became a leading phytomedicine in Europe for "cerebral insufficiency" (a syndrome of memory problems, poor concentration, anxiety, tinnitus, and dizziness in the elderly).

Germany's Commission E (1994) approved Ginkgo extract for treating dementia, intermittent claudication, and vertigo/tinnitus of vascular origin. Herbalists in North America and Europe now commonly recommend Ginkgo for age-related cognitive decline, early-stage Alzheimer's disease, peripheral arterial circulatory disorders, and sometimes mood or vision disorders.

## Phytochemistry (Chemical Constituents)

### Flavonoids

Ginkgo leaves contain 20+ distinct flavonoids, primarily flavonol glycosides derived from quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin. In a typical extract, flavonoid glycosides make up about 22–27% of content. These compounds are potent antioxidants and free-radical scavengers. They also contribute to vasodilatory effects through nitric oxide modulation and endothelial protection.

Upon ingestion, Ginkgo flavonol glycosides are metabolized (the sugar moieties cleaved), yielding aglycones (quercetin, kaempferol) that have pharmacological activity in vivo.

### Terpene Trilactones

Ginkgo is uniquely rich in C15 terpenes known as ginkgolides (A, B, C, J, and M) and a sesquiterpene bilobalide. Standardized extracts contain 5–7% terpene lactones collectively.

Ginkgolides A, B, and C (diterpenoids) are famed for their platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonism, with Ginkgolide B being a particularly potent PAF receptor blocker. This activity underlies Ginkgo's anti-platelet and microcirculatory effects.

Bilobalide, a sesquiterpene, has demonstrated neuroprotective effects – it can enhance neuronal survival under hypoxic conditions, modulate neurotransmitter release (especially GABAergic transmission), and upregulate certain neurotrophic factors in preclinical studies.

### Alkylphenols (Ginkgolic Acids)

Ginkgo seeds and leaves contain minor but significant amounts of alkylphenols: ginkgolic acids, cardanols, and bilobol. Ginkgolic acids are structurally similar to the urushiol of poison ivy and are considered undesirable due to allergenicity and potential toxicity.

Quality standards mandate <5 ppm ginkgolic acids in Ginkgo leaf extracts. Modern extraction processes remove most ginkgolic acids to ensure safety. These compounds can cause contact dermatitis and, in high doses, have shown cytotoxic and genotoxic effects.

### Standardization

The most studied Ginkgo preparation, EGb 761 (a proprietary extract), is standardized to 24% flavone glycosides and 6% terpene lactones, with <5 ppm ginkgolic acids. Many clinical trials and approved herbal drugs in Europe use this or a similarly standardized extract, ensuring batch-to-batch consistency of key actives.

**Bottom line:** Ginkgo biloba's activity is attributed to a synergistic ensemble of constituents: flavonoid glycosides (antioxidant, vasodilatory), terpene lactones (PAF-antagonist, neuroprotective), and others. Reliable clinical efficacy requires preparations that preserve these constituents in known quantities.

## Mechanisms of Action

### Antioxidant and Neuroprotective Effects

Ginkgo biloba exhibits robust antioxidant activity, primarily due to its flavonoids and certain terpenes. Ginkgo flavone glycosides can directly scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit lipid peroxidation in cell membranes.

In vivo studies show that Ginkgo supplementation increases levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) and decreases oxidative damage in brain, liver, and blood tissues.

Preclinical trials demonstrated that EGb 761 protected hippocampal neurons against beta-amyloid-induced toxicity and oxidative apoptosis. Bilobalide and ginkgolides also contribute by stabilizing mitochondrial function during oxidative stress and reducing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.

### Neurovascular and Circulatory Effects

One of Ginkgo's hallmark effects is improving blood flow, especially microcirculation in the brain and peripheral tissues. The mechanisms are multifactorial:

**Vasodilation:** Ginkgo promotes endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Its flavonoids enhance nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in blood vessels and protect NO from oxidative destruction, leading to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.

**Platelet-Activating Factor (PAF) Antagonism:** Ginkgolides, particularly ginkgolide B, are potent antagonists of PAF receptors on platelets and leukocytes. By blocking PAF, Ginkgo reduces platelet aggregation and blood viscosity, contributing to better capillary perfusion and potential protection against thrombus formation.

**Microcirculation and Rheology:** Ginkgo extract improves red blood cell deformability and reduces blood viscosity. These rheological improvements mean better oxygen and glucose delivery to brain tissue.

### Neurotransmitter Modulation

Ginkgo biloba influences multiple neurotransmitter systems:

**Cholinergic system:** Animal studies show that chronic Ginkgo extract administration can increase acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex by mildly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and protecting cholinergic neurons.

**Monoamines:** Rodent studies indicate increased serotonin levels in cortex and increased dopamine levels in prefrontal regions after Ginkgo treatment. Some Ginkgo flavonoids and biflavones have weak MAO inhibitor activity (especially MAO-B).

**GABAergic and glutamatergic systems:** Bilobalide positively modulates GABA_A receptors and can prolong GABA-induced chloride currents. Ginkgolides appear to inhibit the binding of glycine at NMDA receptors, which may reduce NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity.

### Anti-inflammatory and Cell-Signaling Effects

Ginkgolides and flavonoids can inhibit the activation of NF-κB, a key transcription factor driving inflammation. In endothelial cells and macrophages, Ginkgo extract reduced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators like TNF-α, IL-1β, and COX-2 in response to stress stimuli.

In the brain, these anti-inflammatory effects may slow microglial activation and the release of neurotoxic cytokines, which is part of Alzheimer's disease pathology.

## Clinical Indications and Efficacy

### Cognitive Impairment and Dementia

**Evidence Summary:** Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE), particularly EGb 761 at doses of 120–240 mg daily, has been studied in dozens of trials in dementia and cognitive impairment with mixed results. The highest level evidence suggests Ginkgo (particularly 240 mg/day) can produce small but measurable improvements in cognition and daily functioning in dementia.

**Key Clinical Trial (Le Bars et al., 1997):** In a landmark 52-week trial, 309 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's or multi-infarct dementia received 120 mg/day of EGb 761 or placebo. Ginkgo-treated patients showed significant stabilization or improvement on the ADAS-Cog and Geriatric Rating scales compared to placebo. The effect size was modest (~4-point better ADAS-Cog change in Ginkgo group), but statistically significant (PMID: 9343463, DOI: 10.1001/jama.278.16.1327).

**Systematic Reviews:** A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on higher-quality trials reported that EGb 761 (240 mg/day for 22–26 weeks) significantly stabilized or slowed decline in cognition, ADLs, and global functioning in dementia, especially in those with neuropsychiatric symptoms (PMID: 25114079, DOI: 10.3233/JAD-140837).

**Prevention Trials - Negative Results:** The GEM Study (DeKosky et al., 2008) in 3069 elderly participants found that Ginkgo did not reduce the incidence of dementia or Alzheimer's compared to placebo over ~6 years (PMID: 19017911, DOI: 10.1001/jama.2008.683). The GuidAge trial similarly found no significant reduction in progression to AD.

**Clinical Bottom Line:** Ginkgo biloba (especially standardized extracts at 240 mg/day) may provide a small symptomatic benefit in mild-to-moderate dementia, improving cognition, behavior, and ADLs in some patients. It is not a cure and does not appear to prevent dementia in those without it. Its role can be considered in patients who cannot tolerate or access conventional dementia medications, or as an adjunct.

### Tinnitus and Vertigo

**Tinnitus:** Clinical evidence overwhelmingly indicates that Ginkgo does not provide a meaningful benefit for most tinnitus sufferers when tinnitus is the primary complaint. The Cochrane review (Hilton et al., updated 2013) included 4 trials (total n=1543) comparing Ginkgo vs placebo in adults with persistent tinnitus and found no significant difference (PMID: 23543524, DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003852.pub3).

**Vertigo:** There is moderate evidence from European trials that Ginkgo can help reduce frequency/intensity of vertigo attacks, making it a plausible alternative or adjunct to standard vestibular therapy in chronic vertigo.

### Anxiety and Mood Disorders

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** A notable RCT by Woelk et al. (2007) investigated Ginkgo in anxiety with 107 patients with DSM-III-R diagnosed GAD or adjustment disorder with anxious mood. Results showed Hamilton Anxiety Rating (HAM-A) scores improved significantly more on Ginkgo in a dose-dependent manner. The high-dose (480 mg) Ginkgo group's HAM-A decreased by 14.3 points on average, versus 7.8 in placebo (p=0.0003) (PMID: 16808927, DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.05.004).

This trial concluded Ginkgo, especially at 480 mg, was efficacious in reducing anxiety in GAD/adjustment disorder, with an effect size comparable to low-dose benzodiazepines or SSRIs in mild GAD. Ginkgo was well-tolerated with improved cognition alongside anxiolysis.

### Schizophrenia and Tardive Dyskinesia

**Adjunct in Schizophrenia:** A Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis (Brondino et al., 2013) combined 3 RCTs of Ginkgo in chronic schizophrenia and found significant improvement in positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) in the Ginkgo group vs placebo add-on (PMID: 23781271, DOI: 10.1155/2013/915691).

**Tardive Dyskinesia (TD):** A key RCT (Zhang et al., 2011) with 157 schizophrenia patients with established TD were randomized to Ginkgo EGb 761 240 mg/day or placebo for 12 weeks. The Ginkgo group had a significantly greater reduction in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score (mean –2.1 points) than the placebo group (mean –0.1). A response (≥30% reduction in AIMS) occurred in 51% of Ginkgo patients vs only 5% of placebo (PMID: 20868638, DOI: 10.4088/JCP.09m05125yel).

**Clinical Application:** Ginkgo has a niche but notable role in psychiatry as an adjunct. It can modestly improve positive symptoms of schizophrenia and has demonstrated efficacy in tardive dyskinesia, a difficult-to-treat condition.

### Peripheral Vascular Disease (Claudication)

**Intermittent Claudication:** Patients with IC experience exercise-induced calf pain due to limited blood flow. A meta-analysis (Pittler & Ernst, 2000) pooled 8 RCTs and found a significant increase in pain-free walking distance with Ginkgo: a weighted mean difference of +34 meters over placebo (95% CI +22 to +43 m) (PMID: 11014719, DOI: 10.1016/S0002-9343(99)00454-4).

However, a more recent Cochrane Review (2013) concluded there is no evidence that Ginkgo has a clinically significant benefit in intermittent claudication. While some trials showed slight improvements in walking distance, when focusing on higher quality, longer-term studies, the benefits did not clearly outweigh placebo.

**Clinical Bottom Line:** Ginkgo can modestly increase pain-free walking distance in intermittent claudication, but the effect is relatively small. Some patients may experience improved walking tolerance, but guidelines generally do not endorse Ginkgo due to the weak evidence.

### Other Clinical Uses

**Glaucoma:** Small trials have indicated potential benefit in normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), suggesting Ginkgo might enhance ocular blood flow and help preserve visual field. A prospective study found those taking Ginkgo 120 mg twice daily for 8 weeks had significantly improved visual field indices compared to placebo (PMID: 12665209).

**Acute Ischemic Stroke Recovery:** Ginkgo has been studied in China as an add-on to standard stroke rehabilitation. A trial with ~330 patients found that EGb 761 (450 mg/day) started within 7 days of ischemic stroke and continued for 6 months improved cognitive outcomes and activities of daily living at 6 months compared to placebo (PMID: 29930191).

**Memory Enhancement in Healthy Individuals:** Despite marketing claims, substantial research indicates no significant benefit for healthy individuals' memory or concentration. A 2012 meta-analysis (Laws et al.) on cognitive enhancement in non-demented adults found no reliable effect of Ginkgo on a range of cognitive domains (DOI: 10.1002/hup.1268).

## Safety and Adverse Effects

### Common Adverse Effects

Clinical trials and decades of consumer use show that Ginkgo leaf extract is well-tolerated by most. Common side effects (generally mild) include:

- Gastrointestinal upset: stomach discomfort, nausea, diarrhea (<5% incidence)
- Headache: mild headache can occur, possibly due to vasodilation effects
- Dizziness or restlessness: occasionally reported
- Allergic reactions (minor): rare due to low ginkgolic acid content in modern extracts

In long-term use trials (5+ years in GEM study), adverse event rates were similar between Ginkgo and placebo groups, indicating no cumulative toxicity at standard doses.

### Bleeding Risk

The most discussed safety concern with Ginkgo is bleeding potential due to its anti-platelet activity. There have been case reports linking Ginkgo use to bleeding events:

- Intracranial hemorrhage in elderly patients on aspirin and Ginkgo
- Excess bleeding during surgery
- Bleeding with anticoagulants (conflicting data with warfarin)

**Epidemiological Evidence:** The GEM trial and others saw no statistical excess of bleeding events in thousands of patients on Ginkgo vs placebo. A recent retrospective study (2025) did not find a significant association with clinical bleeding in adjusted analysis.

**Bottom Line on Bleeding:** For otherwise healthy individuals, Ginkgo at recommended doses does not appear to appreciably increase bleeding risk on its own. However, in those using anticoagulants or anti-platelet agents, caution is advised. Many clinicians recommend discontinuing Ginkgo 1–2 weeks before elective surgery.

### Seizures and Neurotoxicity

Seizure risk: Ginkgo seeds contain the convulsant toxin 4-O-methylpyridoxine (MPN, "ginkgotoxin") which can cause seizures by antagonizing vitamin B6. This is mainly an issue with consuming large quantities of seeds (especially raw). Ginkgo leaf extracts have much lower MPN.

Large trials haven't shown increased seizure incidence. In GEM, seizure rates were identical in Ginkgo vs placebo groups.

### Carcinogenicity Concerns

The U.S. National Toxicology Program conducted a two-year feeding study of a Ginkgo extract in rats and mice and observed increased incidence of thyroid tumors in rats and liver cancers in mice at high doses. Based on this, IARC classified Ginkgo extract as "possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)" in 2016.

However, epidemiological data in humans (including from the GEM trial participants followed for cancer outcomes) have not shown a cancer signal. The GEM study found no significant differences in overall cancer between Ginkgo and placebo over ~6 years.

**Current Consensus:** While the rodent findings warrant caution, current consensus is that there is no confirmed cancer risk in humans from Ginkgo at usual doses.

## Drug Interactions

### Pharmacodynamic Interactions

**Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets:** Additive bleeding risk. Ginkgo's antiplatelet activity can potentiate the effects of aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs, and warfarin. Patients on these drugs should use Ginkgo cautiously with monitoring for unusual bleeding.

**SSRIs and SNRIs:** Serotonin syndrome risk or bleeding. SSRIs already impair platelet function. Ginkgo on top could further impair aggregation, theoretically raising bleeding risk.

**Anticonvulsants:** Reduced seizure threshold. Ginkgo's ginkgotoxin can reduce seizure threshold by B6 antagonism, and there are case reports of breakthrough seizures in patients on anti-epileptic drugs who started Ginkgo.

### Pharmacokinetic Interactions

**CYP2C19 Substrates:** Induction by Ginkgo can lower drug levels. Ginkgo may induce 2C19, affecting drugs like omeprazole. A study showed Ginkgo significantly increased omeprazole metabolism (PMID: 15608563).

**CYP3A4 Substrates:** Evidence of Ginkgo induction or inhibition of 3A4 is mixed. A study found Ginkgo did not significantly alter midazolam metabolism. However, there was a report that Ginkgo reduced concentrations of HIV protease inhibitor efavirenz by ~25%.

**P-glycoprotein:** Ginkgo's effect on P-gp is unclear. Some evidence suggests Ginkgo might induce P-gp transport activity, potentially affecting drugs like digoxin.

### Management Recommendations

**Moderate risk combinations (monitor or avoid):**
- Ginkgo + anticoagulants/antiplatelets: avoid if possible; if needed, monitor for bleeding
- Ginkgo + anti-seizure meds: avoid due to seizure risk
- Ginkgo + cyclosporine/tacrolimus: avoid or closely check drug levels
- Ginkgo + clozapine: avoid or watch levels/clinical response

**Lower risk combinations (generally fine but stay alert):**
- Ginkgo + most antihypertensives, diabetic meds, antibiotics: no known major issues
- Ginkgo + SSRIs: fine, but counsel on bleeding

## Dosage and Administration

### Standardized Ginkgo Leaf Extract (EGb 761)

**Typical dose:** 120–240 mg per day, divided into 2 or 3 doses

**By indication:**
- **Cognitive impairment/dementia:** 240 mg daily (120 mg twice daily)
- **Intermittent claudication:** 120–160 mg twice daily (total 240–320 mg/day)
- **Anxiety (GAD):** 240–480 mg/day
- **Tinnitus/vertigo:** 120–160 mg twice daily (240–320 mg/day)
- **Adjunct in schizophrenia/TD:** 240 mg/day (120 mg twice daily)

**Administration:** Can be taken with or without food. Ginkgo absorption is not drastically affected by meals.

**Onset of effects:** Not immediate. For cognitive or vascular issues, allow at least 6–8 weeks to judge initial response, with optimal effects often at 12 weeks or beyond.

**Duration:** Ginkgo can be used long-term. In chronic conditions like dementia, it's intended for continuous use. Long-term trials up to 6 years didn't reveal new safety issues.

### Special Populations

**Elderly:** No specific dose reduction needed solely due to age.

**Children:** Not routinely recommended. Avoid in very young children entirely.

**Pregnancy/Lactation:** Avoid use due to lack of data and theoretical bleeding risk.

**Pre-surgery:** Advise patients to stop Ginkgo at least 7–14 days before surgery to minimize bleeding risk.

## Regulatory Status and Quality Control

### Regulatory Classification

**United States:** Sold as a dietary supplement (not FDA-approved as a drug). USP sets quality benchmarks (22–27% flavonoids, 5–7% terpene lactones, <5 ppm ginkgolic acids).

**Europe (EMA/HMPC):** Official European Union herbal monograph recognizes well-established use for "improvement of (age-related) cognitive impairment and of quality of life in mild dementia" and traditional use for "relief of heavy legs and pain related to minor peripheral circulatory disorders."

**Germany Commission E:** Approved Ginkgo leaf extract for "dementia syndromes, peripheral arterial occlusive disease stage II (intermittent claudication), and vertigo & tinnitus of vascular or involutive origin."

### Quality Control and Adulteration

**Standardization:** A key quality aspect is standardization to the specified range of flavonoids and terpene lactones. Legitimate products should state "Standardized to 24% ginkgo flavone glycosides and 6% terpene lactones."

**Adulteration:** Unfortunately, Ginkgo is one of the most commonly adulterated botanical products. Some unethical suppliers spike Ginkgo extracts with inexpensive flavonoids from other sources (like rutin from buckwheat) to artificially inflate the measured "flavone glycosides" content.

To combat this, advanced analytical methods are used including HPLC with ratio checks and detection of unnatural flavonoids.

### Selection Criteria for Quality Products

For high quality:
- Choose products standardized to 24/6%, list the extract ratio and solvent
- Ideally have third-party verification (USP, NSF, ConsumerLab)
- Avoid ultra-cheap bulk powders claiming high flavonoid content
- Check if the product complies with known pharmacopeial standards

## Clinical Bottom Line

### Indications

Ginkgo biloba extract (24%/6% standardized) is primarily indicated for:
- **Mild-to-moderate dementia** (Alzheimer's or vascular) to modestly improve cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and ADLs
- **Intermittent claudication** (increasing pain-free walking distance by ~30–50 meters)
- **Adjunct therapy in anxiety** (one RCT in GAD showed significant benefit at high dose)
- **Tardive dyskinesia** in schizophrenia (RCTs show reduced AIMS scores)

**Not effective for:** preventing dementia in healthy older adults

### Mechanism Summary

Multifactorial – antioxidant, microcirculatory enhancer, PAF inhibitor (anti-platelet), and neurotransmitter modulator. These actions underlie its cognitive and vascular benefits, but also its main risk (bleeding).

### Dosage

Standard dose is 120–240 mg of extract daily, typically divided BID. For dementia and claudication, aim for 240 mg/day. Advise a trial of at least 8–12 weeks to gauge effect.

### Safety

Generally safe and well-tolerated. Principal concern is bleeding risk. Avoid or use caution in patients on anticoagulants/antiplatelets. Advise discontinuing Ginkgo 7–14 days before surgery. Contraindicated in pregnancy due to bleeding and unknown effects.

### Notable Interactions

- Anticoagulants/Antiplatelets: increased bleeding risk
- NSAIDs/SSRIs: additive anti-platelet effect
- Anticonvulsants: may reduce seizure threshold
- Omeprazole: induces CYP2C19, possibly reducing efficacy

### Quality

Use high-quality, standardized products. Many OTC Ginkgo supplements vary; look for those with USP verification or clinically used brands to ensure proper content (24% flavone glycosides, 6% terpenes, <5 ppm ginkgolic acid).

### Efficacy Summary

Ginkgo is not a miracle cure, but it can provide modest symptomatic benefit in cognitive decline (comparable to, or slightly less than, prescription cognitive enhancers) and improve peripheral circulation to a mild degree. Its excellent safety profile (apart from bleeding) makes it a viable option for patients seeking "natural" therapy for these conditions.
